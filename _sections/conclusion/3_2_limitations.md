To get a few big and obvious limitations out of the way first: 
- Everyone could ignore this piece entirely and it is dead on arrival. 
- This project would be a direct threat to some of the most powerful entities in science, and they will likely actively work against it. 
- Despite my best efforts, I could be completely misinformed and missing something fundamental about the underlying technologies. 
- The social tensions between the relevant development communities could be too great to overcome. 

Beyond those, there are several open questions that deserve further consideration:

- identity
- security
- privacy
- redundancy
- web-compatibility
- ld standards sort of suck	
	- "the world runs on tables"
	- this will primarily be a matter of conversion and making a set of very basic tools for manipulating the standards
- adversarial development/cooption
- performance: actually not an issue or object of focus. we don't necessarily *want* to be able to index across everything, and constantly optimizing for perf is how we got here. We want to have technologies that we control and reflect our work rather than technologies that are magic. We *want* the system to be difficult to make full scrapes to capture and repackage. We *want* connections to be purposeful and transparent, rather than having arbitrary crawlers sucking up all scientific data.
- manipulation: ppl might lie! ppl already lie! and we handle ambiguity all the time. the real dangerous thing is a system that *presents* itself as infallible/neutral/true.
