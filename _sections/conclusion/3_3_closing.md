zooming out a bit, what we set out to do is sketch a strategy for building the parts of scientific infrastructure that are currently missing. we've tried to be specific enough to be actionable, but general enough to not overprescribe ourself out of being able to explore alternative approaches and handle unanticipated development problems.

The modalities of our system are also those of the general need for digital infrastructure filled in by social media and cloud providers. The eventual goal is to build a set of tools that provide a real alternative to 


This isn't just a technical project: its an ethical one. In order to see just how structured the practice of science is by the profiting industries that surroudn it, it needs to be possible to imagine an alternative. Infrastructure isn't just about making things easier, it's about reversing the course of science being swallowed up and bent to the will of profit, making it impossible to do what we think we're doing by ignoring infrastructural problems and focusing on the science by contributing to basic knowledge. What are we doing here?

Maybe scientists can spare a little militancy and to evaluate the position of their work in the broader scope of the world. If the act of fixing our own shit could help broader problems 

Remember the internet itself was made so that scientists could communicate. We can do that again. (link to some of those early arpanet chats from like the first spam)
