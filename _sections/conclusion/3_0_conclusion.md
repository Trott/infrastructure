To take stock:

To approach the deficits in the basic digital infrastructure of science, we divided them into three domains: systems for sharing **[data](#shared-data), [tools](#shared-tools), and [knowledge](#shared-knowledge).** These map onto three rough patterns of infrastructure that define the current cloud orthodoxy era of the internet: **storage, computation, and communication.**

We traced the historical development of prior infrastructural to learn from their successes and failures, conditioned as they are by the contingency and combinatorics of the technologies that existed at the time. We started close at hand [within science](#misincentives-in-scientific-software), and ranged more broadly into lessons from [internet protocols](#protocols-not-platforms), [pirates](#archives-need-communities), the [semantic](#the-long-now-of-immediacy-vs-idealism) [web](#neatness-vs-scruffiness) and [linked data](#folk-federation), [early wikis](#the-wiki-way), and the [fediverse](#forums--feeds)/indieweb.  

Our goal throughout was to sketch a **realistic plan** by which existing technologies could make an emergent interoperable system that was *expansive and evolving* beyond the isolated use of its quasi-independent parts. Our sketch was intended to be *specific* enough to be an actionable blueprint for dispersed groups to work in parallel, but *general* enough to allow refinement through inevitable complexity. We attempted to balance several constraints, primarily **technical capability** and **social compatibility,** but also simplicity and expressiveness, structure and permissiveness; systems that are personal and scalable, respect privacy and empower mutual organization. We are neither politically nor economically neutral, and see the infrastractural deficits of science as reflective of information's broader role as the currently dominant mode of capital accumulation. Accordingly we are searching for system design that can dismantle regimes of surveillance, extraction, and the commodification of information to **re-decentralize** our digital technologies for *people* not *profit.*
