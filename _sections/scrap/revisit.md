Stuff that's common between analysis and experimental tools

- make tool development easier: Linking domains of data manipulation with analysis makes developing tools easier. Rather than having to reimplement basic routines like data loading and parameterization, developers can contribute to and use methods from a common framework. Since we aren't intending a single framework, but instead a means of linking them, it is possible to spread development of different features beyond the core team, so for example creating links from varying data formats would expand the scope of data a tool is useful for.
