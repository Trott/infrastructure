Confused? Any other online community would count each of these "negatives" as a terrible flaw, and the contradictions as impossible to reconcile. Perhaps wiki works because the other online communities don't. {% cite leufWikiWayQuick2001a -l 329 %} and in [WhyWikiWorks](http://wiki.c2.com/?WhyWikiWorks)

- There is no larger collective digital knowledge organization effort, aside from the internet itself, than Wikipedia. 
- Wikis now are ubiquitous, but they tend to be extremely circumscribed in purpose, audience, etc. and we don't tend to use them for communication.
- Before Wikipedia, there were a series of independent precursor wikis
	- c2
	- meatball - "SunirShah founded MeatballWiki to absorb and enlarge the discussion of what wiki and wiki like sites might be. That discussion still simmers here. But here it can take on a negative tone sounding more like complaining. On meatball, under Sunir's careful leadership, the ideas, wild or not, stay amazingly upbeat.

> It’s not too late to turn things around. Specs could be moved back into the wiki until they’re nearly done. Editors, instead of being gatekeepers, could be helpful moderators. A clear process for making controvertial decisions could be decided on. And the validator could follow consensus instead of leading it. But do the people running the show want this?

> Standards bodies tread a fine line between organizations for the public good and shelters for protecting collusion that would be otherwise illegal under antitrust law. For the dominent vendors involved, the goal is to give the illusion of openness while giving themselves full control to enforce their will behind the scenes.
>
> The IETF is a good example of this. Often lauded by the public as a model of openness and and and freedom, the reality is that working group chairs, appointed by a self-elected ruling board, get away with declaring whatever they want (usually an inferior and difficult to implement alternative) as “rough consensus”, routinely ignoring comments from the public and objections from working group members. One working group (in charge of DNS extentsions) went so far as to censor mail from working group members. The dictators running the IETF, when informed, didn’t seem to mind.
> 
> Is the same sort of thing at work in the Pie/Echo/Atom Project? It appears so at first glance: Sam running the show from behind the scenes, putting friends in charge of the specs (although that isn’t what actually happened). The lack of a dispute-resolution process only makes things worse: when there’s no clear guide on how to make decisions or contributions, it’s far from obvious how to challenge a decision Sam has made. {% cite swartzSecretsStandards2003 %}

> Two essential features coordinate this information to better serve our organizational decision-making, learning, and memory. The first is our constellation of Working Groups that maintain and distribute local, specialized knowledge to other groups across the network. [...] A second, more emergent property is the subgroup of IBL researchers who have become experts, liaisons, and interpreters of knowledge across the network. These members each manage a domain of explicit records (e.g., written protocols) and tacit information (e.g., colloquialisms, decision histories) that are quickly and informally disseminated to address real-time needs and problems. A remarkable nimbleness is afforded by this system of rapid responders deployed across our web of Working Groups. However, this kind of internalized knowledge can be vulnerable to drop-out when people leave the collaboration, and can be complex to archive. An ongoing challenge for our collaboration is how to archive both our explicit and tacit processes held in both people and places. This is not only to document our own history but as part of a roadmap for future science teams, whose dynamics are still not fully understood. {% cite woolKnowledgeNetworksHow2020 %}

> The Semantic Web is about two things. It is about common formats for integration and combination of data drawn from diverse sources, where on the original Web mainly concentrated on the interchange of documents. It is also about language for recording how the data relates to real world objects. That allows a person, or a machine, to start off in one database, and then move through an unending set of databases which are connected not by wires but by being about the same thing. https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/

!! Semantic combination of databases in science are also not new {% cite cheungSemanticWebApproach2007 simaEnablingSemanticQueries2019 %}. We need both though! semantic federated databases!
