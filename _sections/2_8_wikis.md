What rules do you put in place? What software do you use? {% cite swartzMakingMoreWikipedias2006 %}

Aside from maybe the internet itself, there is no larger public digital knowledge organization effort than Wikipedia. While there are many lessons to be learned from Wikipedia itself, it emerged from a prior base of thought and experimentation in radically permissive, self-structuring read/write --- sometimes called "peer production" {% cite hillWikipediaEndOpen2019 %} --- communities. Wikis are now quasi-ubiquitous today[^corporatewikis], largely thanks to wikipedia (citation needed?), but it specific history and intent to be an *encyclopedia* entwines it with a very particular technological and social system that obscures some of the broader dream of early wikis. 

Aaron Swartz, in his series of essays written while running for Wikimedia Foundation's board of directors in 2006, describes the founder of Wikipedia's peculiar accounting for the number of people responsible for its content, attributing it to his personal history:

> “I’m not a wiki person who happened to go into encyclopedias,” Wales told the crowd at Oxford. “I’m an encyclopedia person who happened to use a wiki.” {% cite swartzWhoWritesWikipedia2006 %}

And further:

> But Wikipedia isn’t even a typical community. Usually Internet communities are groups of people who come together to discuss something, like cryptography or the writing of a technical specification. Perhaps they meet in an IRC channel, a web forum, a newsgroup, or on a mailing list, but the focus is always something “out there”, something outside the discussion itself.
> 
> But with Wikipedia, the goal is building Wikipedia. It’s not a community set up to make some other thing, it’s a community set up to make itself. And since Wikipedia was one of the first sites to do it, we know hardly anything about building communities like that. {% cite swartzMakingMoreWikipedias2006 %}

We know a lot more now than in 2006, of course. Wikipedia has since spawned a [huge number](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Complete_list_of_Wikimedia_projects) of technologies and projects like [MediaWiki](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki) and [Wikidata](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikidata), each with their own long and occasionally torrid histories. The dream of a centralized, but mass-edited encyclopedia of everything seems to be waning, and its slow retreat from wild openness has run parallel to a long decline in contributors {% cite hillWikipediaEndOpen2019 halfakerRiseDeclineOpen2013 %}. The discussions about what radically open web communities could be like, inventing a world in realtime, are a continuous history with projects like Wikipedia and have lessons with familiar echoes.

The first wiki was launched in 1995[^wikistart] (and is [still online](http://wiki.c2.com/)) and came to be known as Ward's wiki after its author [WardCunningham](http://wiki.c2.com/?WardCunningham). Technically, it was extremely simple: a handful of [TextFormattingRules](http://wiki.c2.com/?TextFormattingRules) and use of [WikiCase](http://wiki.c2.com/?WikiCase) where if you [JoinCapitalizedWords](http://wiki.c2.com/?JoinCapitalizedWords) you create a link to a (potentially new) [WikiPage](http://wiki.c2.com/?WikiPage) --- and the ability for anyone to edit any page. These very simple [WikiDesignPrinciples](http://wiki.c2.com/?WikiDesignPrinciples) led to a sprawling and continuous conversation that spanned more than a [decade](http://wiki.c2.com/?WardsWikiTenthAnniversary) and thousands ([23,244](http://c2.com/wiki/history/)) of pages that, because of the nature of the medium, is left fully preserved in amber. Those conversations are a history of thought on what makes wiki communities work (eg. [WhyWikiWorks](http://wiki.c2.com/?WhyWikiWorks), [WhyWikiWorksNot](http://wiki.c2.com/?WhyWikiWorksNot)), and what is needed to sustain them. 

One tension that emerged early and was never fully resolved by these wikis is the balance between "[DocumentMode](http://wiki.c2.com/?DocumentMode)" writing that serves as linearly-readable reference material, similar to that of Wikipedia, and "[ThreadMode](http://wiki.c2.com/?ThreadMode)" writing that is a nonlinear representation of a conversation. Ward Cunningham and other more organizationally-oriented contributors opposed ThreadMode (eg. [ThreadModeConsideredHarmful](http://wiki.c2.com/?ThreadModeConsideredHarmful), [InFavorOfDissertation](http://wiki.c2.com/?InFavorOfDissertation)) for a number of reasons, largely due to the [ThreadMess](http://wiki.c2.com/?ThreadMess) and [WikiChaos](http://wiki.c2.com/?WikiChaos) it had the potential of creating. 

> I occasionally suggest how this site should be used. My [GoodStyle](http://wiki.c2.com/?GoodStyle) suggestions have been here since the beginning and are linked from the edit page should anyone forget. I have done my best to discourage dialog [InFavorOfDissertation](http://wiki.c2.com/?InFavorOfDissertation) which offers a better fit to this medium. I've been overruled. I will continue to make small edits to pages for the sake of brevity. -- [WardCunningham](http://wiki.c2.com/?WardCunningham) {% cite C2wikiWikiHistory %} 

Most pages are thus a combination of both, usually with some DocumentMode text at the top with ThreadMode conversations interspersed throughout without necessarily having any clean delineation between the two. Far from just being raw disorder, this mixed mode of writing gave it a peculiar character of being *both* a folk reference for a library of concepts *as well as* a history of discussion that made the contingency of that reference material plain. Beka Valentine put it well:

> c2wiki is an exercise in dialogical methods. of laying bare the fact that knowledge and ideas are not some truth delivered from On High, but rather a social process, a conversation, a dialectic, between various views and interests {% cite valentineC2wikiExerciseDialogical2021 %}

This tension and its surrounding discussions point to the need for multiple representations of a single idea: that both the social and reference representations of a concept are valuable, but aren't necessarily best served by being represented in the same place. There was relatively common understanding that the natural order of things was to have many ThreadMode conversations that would gradually be converted to DocumentMode in a process of [BrainStormFirstCleanLater](http://wiki.c2.com/?BrainStormFirstCleanLater). Many [proposed solutions](http://wiki.c2.com/?ConvertThreadModeToDocumentMode) orbit around making parallel pages with similar names (like \<pagename\>Discussion) to clean up a document while preserving the threads (though there were plenty of interesting alternatives, eg. [DialecticMode](http://wiki.c2.com/?DialecticMode))[^contemporarywikithought].

Wikipedia cut the Gordian Knot by splitting each page into a separate *Article* and *Talk* pages, with the talk page in its own **Namespace** -- eg. [Gordian_Knot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordian_Knot) vs [Talk:Gordian_Knot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Gordian_Knot). Talk pages resemble a lot of the energy of early wikis: disorganized, sometimes silly, sometimes angry, and usually charmingly pedantic. Namespaces extend the traditional "everything is a page" notion encoded in the WikiCase link system by giving different pages different roles. In addition to having parallel conversations on articles and talk pages, it is possible to have template pages that can be included on wiki pages with `{% raw %}{{double curly bracket}}{% endraw %}` syntax -- eg. [Template:Citation_Needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Citation_needed) renders `{% raw %}{{Citation needed}}{% endraw %}` as <sup><i>[citation needed]</i></sup>. Talk pages have their own **functional differentiation,** with features for threading and annotating discussions that aren't present on the main article pages (see [Wikipedia:Flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Flow) {% cite WikipediaFlow2021 %}).

The complete segregation of discussion to Talk pages is driven by Wikipedia's aspirations as an encyclopedia, with reminders that is the "[sole purpose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Don't_lose_the_thread#Move_to_the_article_talk_page)" peppered throughout the rules and guidelines. The presence of messy subjective discussions would of course be discordant with the very austere and "neutral" articles of an encyclopedia. There are no visible indications that the talk pages even exist in the main text, and so even deeply controversial topics have no references to the conversations in talk pages that surround them --- despite this being a requested feature by both administrators and editors {% cite schneiderUnderstandingImprovingWikipedia2011 %}. 

Talk pages serve as one of the primary points of coordination and conflict resolution on Wikipedia, and also provide a low-barrier entrypoint for questions posed to a space they perceive to be "an approchable community of experts" {% cite viegasTalkYouType2007 %}. The separation of Talk pages and the [labyrinthine rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Talk_page_guidelines) governing their use function to obscure the dialogical and collective production of knowledge at the heart of wikis and Wikipedia. The body of thought that structures Wikipedia, most of which is in its [Wikipedia:\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal) namespace, is immense and extremely valuable, but is largely hidden from most people. Since Wikipedia is "always already there" often without trace of its massively collective nature, relatively few people ever contribute to it. Reciprocally, since acknowledging personal contribution is or point of view is [explicitly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research) against some of its [core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view) policies and [traditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_thread_mode), there is little public credit outside the Wikipedia community itself for the labor of maintaining it. 

The forking of Wards Wikis into the first [SisterSites](http://wiki.c2.com/?SisterSites) teaches a parallel strain of lessons. Ward's Wiki started as a means of organizing knowledge for the Portland Pattern Repository[^wardinvite], a programming community (referred to as [DesignPatterns](http://wiki.c2.com/?DesignPatterns) below), and in 1998 they were overwhelmed with proponents of [ExtremeProgramming](http://wiki.c2.com/?ExtremeProgramming), which caused the first fissure in the wiki:

> XP advocates seemed to be talking about XP at every possible opportunity and seemingly on every page with content the least bit related to software development. This annoyed a number people who were here to discuss patterns, leading to the tag [XpFreeZone](http://wiki.c2.com/?XpFreeZone), as a request not to talk about ExtremeProgramming on that page. 
>
> It was difficult to pick out the [DesignPatterns](http://wiki.c2.com/?DesignPatterns) discussion on [RecentChanges](http://wiki.c2.com/?RecentChanges)[^recentchanges], because most of the activity was related to ExtremeProgramming. Eventually, most of the [DesignPatterns](http://wiki.c2.com/?DesignPatterns) people left, to discuss patterns in a "quieter" environment, and people started referring to this site as [WardsWiki](http://wiki.c2.com/?WardsWiki) instead of the [PortlandPatternRepository](http://wiki.c2.com/?PortlandPatternRepository) {% cite C2wikiWikiHistory %}

One of the first and most influential Sister Sites was [Meatball Wiki](http://meatballwiki.org/), described on Wards Wiki:

> SunirShah founded MeatballWiki to absorb and enlarge the discussion of what wiki and wiki like sites might be. That discussion still simmers here. But here it can take on a negative tone sounding more like complaining. On meatball, under Sunir's careful leadership, the ideas, wild or not, stay amazingly upbeat. - [SisterSites](http://wiki.c2.com/?SisterSites)

MeatballWiki became the spiritual successor to Ward's Wiki, which at that point had its own momentum of culture less interested in being the repository of wiki thought[^meatballthought]. Though there are a truly monstrous number of ideas on MeatballWiki, the most relevant here here might be those concerning its very existence as a SisterSite. A series of discussions that have a relatively low word count have become fundamental background knowledge in free and open source computing, in part: [RightToFork](http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/RightToFork), [RightToLeave](http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/RightToLeave), and [EnlargeSpace](http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/EnlargeSpace).

!! So multiple namespaces with functional differences can accomodate the difference in [perception of time](https://communitywiki.org/wiki/TimeInWikis) between thread and document mode, but we still need to preserve the voice of the contributor to be present across multiple representations of the same information.  !! continuity with highlighting and annotation, need for multiple namespaces with parallel forms of conversation, but also need to link between them. Practically speaking this requires communications systems have some means of visible backlinking. !! effectively this means a multilayered document that corresponds to a multilayered namespace. !! that in turn implies some means of moderation about which backlinks/namespaces are shown.

!! return to after discussing right to fork and the need for cultural regeneration

Editorship has steadily declined from a peak in 2007. !! its relatively invisible community systems make it mostly a matter of chance or ideology that new contributors are attracted int he first place. !!  In its calcification of norms, largely to protect against legitimate challenges to the integrity of the encyclopedia, any newcomers that do find their way into editing now have little chance to catch a foothold in the culture before they are frustrated by (sometimes algorithmic) rejection {% cite hillWikipediaEndOpen2019 halfakerRiseDeclineOpen2013 %}. 

Important principles:
- right to fork - splitting of community from difference of interests
- overlays and namespaces
- tension between unitary platform, vs. complexity of linking
from wikipedia
- becoming too massive causes difficult to manage social problems, necessitating right to fork. stabler smaller communities that are linked through a common means of practice.
- transclusion

Often lauded by the public as a model of openness and and and freedom, the reality is that working group chairs, appointed by a self-elected ruling board, get away with declaring whatever they want (usually an inferior and difficult to implement alternative) as “rough consensus”, routinely ignoring comments from the public and objections from working group members. One working group (in charge of DNS extentsions) went so far as to censor mail from working group members. The dictators running the IETF, when informed, didn’t seem to mind.

> Two essential features coordinate this information to better serve our organizational decision-making, learning, and memory. The first is our constellation of Working Groups that maintain and distribute local, specialized knowledge to other groups across the network. [...] A second, more emergent property is the subgroup of IBL researchers who have become experts, liaisons, and interpreters of knowledge across the network. These members each manage a domain of explicit records (e.g., written protocols) and tacit information (e.g., colloquialisms, decision histories) that are quickly and informally disseminated to address real-time needs and problems. A remarkable nimbleness is afforded by this system of rapid responders deployed across our web of Working Groups. However, this kind of internalized knowledge can be vulnerable to drop-out when people leave the collaboration, and can be complex to archive. An ongoing challenge for our collaboration is how to archive both our explicit and tacit processes held in both people and places. This is not only to document our own history but as part of a roadmap for future science teams, whose dynamics are still not fully understood. {% cite woolKnowledgeNetworksHow2020 %}

But Amy Guy long made the case in the group that actually the divisions between the groups were very shallow and that with just a few tweaks we could actually bridge the gap (this was the real origin of the Social Web Protocols document, which though it eventually became a document of the different things we produced, was originally an analysis of how they weren't so different at all). {% cite lemmer-webberStandardsDivisionsCollaboration2018 %}
