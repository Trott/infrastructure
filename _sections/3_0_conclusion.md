!! summary of the system design

!! description of a new kind of scientific consensus *en toto*


## Shared Governance

!! the broad and uncertain future here is how this system will be goverened and how it will be oeprated. Though we design a system that decentralizes its operation, decentralizing power is not an automatic guarantee of the technology, so we need to remember the main question here is a refocusing of our culture *along with* refocusing our technology. We need to reconceptualize what we demand from our communication systems, how much power and agency we have over them, and how we relate with other scientists. 

Dont want to be prescriptive here, but that we can learn from previous efforts like  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evergreen_(software) , 

## Contrasting visions for science

!! through this text I have tried to sketch in parallel the vision of scientific practice as I see it heading now, into a platform capitalist hell, and an alternative, which is not a utopia but it is a place where we save a shitload of labor and (revisit the harms in the introduction). 

### The worst platform capitalist world

!! ahh huh you know what it is

### What we could hope for

!! ya remake this description only less ivy and rosewaters and reintroduce some of the frustrations that might occur in the system. yno there are limitations but shit would actually genuinely be useful.
