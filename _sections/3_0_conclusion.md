!! summary of the system design

!! description of a new kind of scientific consensus *en toto*


## Shared Governance

!! the broad and uncertain future here is how this system will be goverened and how it will be oeprated. Though we design a system that decentralizes its operation, decentralizing power is not an automatic guarantee of the technology, so we need to remember the main question here is a refocusing of our culture *along with* refocusing our technology. We need to reconceptualize what we demand from our communication systems, how much power and agency we have over them, and how we relate with other scientists. 

Dont want to be prescriptive here, but that we can learn from previous efforts like  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evergreen_(software) , 

!! multiplicity is in itself a form of governance, where rather than needing to canalize things into a single decision, it is possible to have all the options exist simultaneously and let history sort them out. http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/VotingIsEvil  http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/EnlargeSpace

## Tactics & Strategy

!! How do we make this happen? Practical recommendations for various stakeholders

!! Some of the tactical vision for this is embedded in the structure and serial order of the piece. There is no reason that the metadata framework described here needs to be intrinsically linked to the p2p data sharing system, and there is no inherent need to first arrive at some state of quasi-standardization, but because many data standards are already in OWL or other RDF system and need some mechanism for making extensions, there is an immediate practical problem solved by implementing a linked data layer on top of a data standard and sharing system. There is little reason for a developer of an experimental library to declare a rich metadata system, but if it was possible to use it to make data output easier and make the system more powerful in the process, we then have a strong incentive.

## Contrasting visions for science

!! through this text I have tried to sketch in parallel the vision of scientific practice as I see it heading now, into a platform capitalist hell, and an alternative, which is not a utopia but it is a place where we save a shitload of labor and (revisit the harms in the introduction). 

### The worst platform capitalist world

!! ahh huh you know what it is

### What we could hope for

!! ya remake this description only less ivy and rosewaters and reintroduce some of the frustrations that might occur in the system. yno there are limitations but shit would actually genuinely be useful.
