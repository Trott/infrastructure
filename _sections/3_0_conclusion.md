Much of what I describe here was also described by Tim Berners-Lee in 2000:

> When I proposed the web in 1989, the driving force I had in mind was communication through shared knowledge, and the driving "market" for it was collaboration among people at work and at home. By building a hypertext Web, a group of people of whatever size could easily express themselves, quickly acquire and convey knowledge, overcome misunderstandings, and reduce duplication of effort. This would give people in a group a new power to build something together. 
>
> People would also have a running model of their plans and reasoning. A web of knowledge linked through hypertextw ould contain a snapshot of their shared understanding. When new people joined a group they would have the legacy of decisions and reasons available for inspection. When people left the group their work would already have been captured and integrated. [...]
>
> The intention was that the Web be used as a personal information system, and a group tool on all scalked, from the team of two creating a flyer for the local elementary school play to the world population deciding on ecological issues. 
>
> To be able to really work together on the Web, we need much better tools: better formats for presenting information to the user; more intuitive interfaces for editing and changing information; seamless integration of other tools, such as chat rooms, and audio- and videoconferencing, with Web editing. We need the ability to store on one server an annotation about a Web page on another; simple access controls for gorup memebership, and for tracking changes to documents. While some of this work involved leading-edge reserach, a lot of it consists of trying to adapt existing computer systems to the global hypertext world. {% cite berners2008weaving -l p.162-163 %}


I don't claim to know more about why this vision hasn't yet been realized than its inventor, but I think part of it might be strategic. It's not zenough to describe or even build liberatory technology, you need some means of getting it in people's hands --- and if they already have it in their hands, you need to give them a good reason to swap. I think another is context: they were designing for the whole internet first, without any  *particular* problem to be solved (except, maybe, the whole internet as the problem). By seeding the tools and the culture in science, with its relatively unique ability to expend non-profit-driven labor, we might stand a chance of pushing the cart over the hill. To do that we need to see the problems of "open science" as much larger than just science, but reflective of our entire information ecosystem.
