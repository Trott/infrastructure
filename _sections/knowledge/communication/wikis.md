#### Trackers, Clients, & Wikis

<div class="draft-text" markdown="1">
One of the basic weaknesses is the document-only model, but recursive cells fix that. 

Having a wiki page like [[topic]] in the context of a federated wiki looks different, like the agora, where we can combine multiple people's representation of the topic and pull them. Since we can split documents into subcells, we can then also transclude them in a wiki bidirectionally: in the document metadata, but also from the wiki side.

This is how the fedwiki works! http://marc.tries.fed.wiki/view/c2-for-me/ward.eu.wiki.org/c2-for-me/wellspring.fed.wiki/welcome-visitors

!! in a linear system this gets us transclusion. one of the major flaws of the mediawiki ecosystem is the adherence to the page-only document model. If instead a page was an arbitrary structuring unit of any number of other containers, then it would be possible to do things like subdocument transclusion, building complex and recursive concepts that consist of many layers of meaning (eg. all the times you're forced to use subobjects which are awkward and unnecessary).

</div>

The final set of social interfaces are those for collective governance of the system. So far we have generalized documents "vertically" into recursive typed cells, "horizontally" into linked cells for communication, and then blurred their independence by and extended them into incompatible media with overlays. The remaining piece we need are multi-authored documents: **wikis**. We'll pick up the threads left hanging from our description of [bittorrent trackers](#archives-need-communities) and knit them in with those from [the wiki way](#the-wiki-way) to describe how systems for surfacing procedural and technical knowledge work can also serve as a basis of searching, indexing, and governing the rest of the system. Where the rest of our interfaces were means of creating particular kinds of structured links, we'll also describe wikis as a means of interacting directly with links to negotiate the relationships between the multiplicity of our folksonomic schema. In the process we'll give some structure to the **clients** and **trackers** that serve and organize them.

Our notion of recursive cell-like documents is already a good basis for wiki pages. **Multi-author** documents should already be possible with a permission system that we have invoked previously to limit read access, and so the most radically open, publicly editable wikis would just have edit permissions open to anyone. The **version history** that makes the notion of [SoftSecurity](http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/SoftSecurity) possible should also be a general property of links in our system. The other concept we'll borrow from traditional wikis is the model where **pages represent topics.** Practically, let's suppose this means that within documents beneath some namespace like `@jonny:wiki`, we can make wikilinks to [[New Pages]] that imply links to `@jonny:wiki:New_Pages` --- though for the sake of simplicity in this section we will assume that our wiki starts at the root of the `@jonny` namespace.

We want to preserve two types of multiplicity: the multiplicity of *representations* (as in `Talk:` pages) and *instances* of a given topic, or the ability for multiple peers to have linked versions that potentially transclude content from other peers, but are ultimately independent. Both can use different components of a namespace: for multiplicity of representation we might follow the example of mediawiki and use parallel namespaces like `@jonny:talk`, and multiplicity of instances follows naturally from parallel peers by linking `@jonny:wiki:My_Page` to `@rumbly:wiki:My_Page`.

Wikis that represent multiple instances of a given page are already a subject of active experimentation. Flancian's Agora is one example, which is based on markdown files in git repositories, and markdown files with the same name in federated repositories are presented on the same page. A much older project[^e2history], [everything2](https://everything2.com/) is built around multiple "[writeups](https://everything2.com/title/Writeup)" for a given "[node](https://everything2.com/title/Node)." Multiple instances of a page are also a defining feature of Ward Cunningham's [federated wiki](http://ward.fed.wiki.org/view/welcome-visitors/view/home-in-the-federation), which has a vertical "strip" based interface where clicking the colored squares at the bottom of a given page will open another strip to show another user's instance of the page. We'll borrow Ward's terminology and refer to this kind of wiki as a federated wiki.

[^e2history]: everything2 (or e2) users tend to be, uh, [floridly sarcastic](https://everything2.com/title/Everything%253A+In+the+Beginning), and so its history is not as clearly laid out as the other old wikilike sites.

Federated wikis already have some broader purchase as "personal knowledge graphs," {% cite balogPersonalKnowledgeGraphs2019 %} where people use tools like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) or [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to keep a set of linked, semistructured personal notes. Rather than thinking of a wiki as wikipedia, with pages that aspire to be uniformly named and written, personal knowledge graphs take whatever form is useful to the person maintaining them. This maps neatly onto our namespaces and recursive documents as a means of *organizing our system of links.* 

<div class="draft-text">Put some demo cells here!</div>

Say we have a very simple project structure that consists of a dataset with two tables and a document with the date of the experiment and some short description of the data. In our pseudocode:

```turtle
<#project>
  a @jonny:Project

  dataset
    @format:csv 
      table1
      table2

  document
    a @jupyter:notebook

    @schema:Date dateCollected
    Description
      "This is the data that I collected"
```

This has a natural representation in our wiki as a set of nested cells: the `@jonny:project` page has two child cells, one for the dataset and one for the document, which have their own child cells that represent the tables, date, and description according to their types. Since the relationships between our cells can also typed, ie. have an associated predicate like `before`, `after`, or `inReplyTo`, we'll use two additional types to differentiate nested cells: 

- `child` (and its inverse `parent`) cells correspond to a cell's position in our namespace, so we could find our data at `@jonny:project:dataset`.
- `transcludes` (and its inverse `transcluded`) indicates some other cell that we represent on a given wiki page, as we might want to do if we wanted to embed one of our plots in a post.
- And other cells linked with bare `[[wikilinks]]` are untyped.

This gives us a bidirectional representation of our link structure: and with it an interface for browsing and managing all the various types of objects that we have described so far. 

Since schemas, or abstract representations of the links a type might have, are themselves made of links, these too can be managed with a wiki. [Semantic mediawiki](https://www.semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Semantic_MediaWiki) and its [page schemas](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Page_Schemas) extension implement a system like this. For example, the [Autopilot wiki](https://wiki.auto-pi-lot.com) has a [form](https://wiki.auto-pi-lot.com/index.php/Form:Build_Guide) to submit build guides for experimental apparatuses. Build guides have a [schema](https://wiki.auto-pi-lot.com/index.php/Category:Construction_Build_Guide) and an associated [template](https://wiki.auto-pi-lot.com/index.php/Template:Build_Guide) that lays out the form input on the created page and makes the semantic wikilinks that declare its properties like `[[Is Version::2]]`. 

This system is semantically rich while also being flexible, as everything reduces down to semantic wikilinks on a page, so free text can be used fluidly along with structured schemas, forms, and templates. The wide open structuring space of the wiki handles the messy iteration of technical knowledge work well while also having enough structure to be computer readable. A page for an [amplifier](https://wiki.auto-pi-lot.com/index.php/HiFiBerry_Amp2) makes the datasheet, serial protocol, and the GPIO pins it needs available via an [API call](https://www.semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:API) while also carrying on a continuous effort to crudely defeat its low-pass output filter. A [plugin](https://wiki.auto-pi-lot.com/index.php/Plugin:Autopilot_Paper) page can credit the papers it was used in by DOI and the python packages needed to run it while also describing how to void the warranty of your oscilloscope to unlock additional functionality. 

The page-centric model of semantic wikis poses a problem, though. The guide for building the [Autopilot Behavior Box](https://wiki.auto-pi-lot.com/index.php/Autopilot_Behavior_Box) has semantic annotations describing the CAD schematics, materials, and tools that it uses. This works fine for [other assembled parts](https://wiki.auto-pi-lot.com/index.php/Autopilot_Tripoke) or schematics like [3d printed parts](https://wiki.auto-pi-lot.com/index.php/Autopilot_Nosepoke_Cap) that have pages of their own, because their pages can contain the additional properties that describes them like the associated `.stl` files. Materials like screws are trickier. Each screw varies along about a dozen dimensions, and so that either requires making a separate page for each individual screw or use workarounds[^semworkarounds] that reduce the maximum depth of representation to two layers and add other nasty complexities.

[^semworkarounds]: like [subobjects](https://www.semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Subobject) or [record types](https://www.semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Type_Record)

A recursive cellular system avoids these problems and provides a uniform interface to complex representations. We can create schema for experiments that allow for a build guide, which can contain assembled component descriptions, which can contain materials, etc. When using that schema to describe a new experiment, the researcher can be prompted for any of the possible available fields in the recursive model while also allowing for free space to write in the semi-structure of the building blocks. Extending an existing schema is just a matter of transcluding it and then modifying it as needed. With the ability for our interface to assign fixed IDs for these objects or generate unique hashes based on their contents, the tension of ephemeral object declaration with unique addresses disappears.

The tension of arbitrarily flexible personal knowledge graphs with multiscale organization with other peers remains, though. Approaching from the other side of discovery, rather than declaration of information leads back to considering the structure of our p2p client and tracker-like systems. The most immediate problem we face is the need to reconcile the differences between multiple instantiations of overlapping representations of concepts that change through time. That sounds a lot like version control system, and a VCS like git or mercurial should be a natural part of our client. Where IPFS is "a single bittorrent swarm, exchanging objects within one Git repository," {% cite benetIPFSContentAddressed2014 %} we make a mild modification and think of a single bittorrent swarm with a git repository per peer (also see [IPLD](https://ipld.io/docs/) {% cite protocollabsIPLDDocs2021 %}). Git [stores files](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects) as [content-addressed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage) "blobs" of binary indexed by "trees" that represent the file hierarchy {% cite chaconProGit2020 %}. Our client can do something similar, except using the triplet link structure for trees rather than typical duplet links. Another peer querying our data would then resolve our identity to the top of the tree, our client would then either serve the parts of our tree that the peer has access to or else let them traverse some subsection of it, and they could then request any file "blobs" that the tree points to[^justasketch]. 

[^justasketch]: That's sufficient detail for a sketch, but there is of course a great deal of subtlety that would need to be resolved in an implementation. For example, see {% cite aleksandersenFourP2PDistribution2020 hartgerinkVerifiedSharedModular2019 %}.

By itself this would have a lot of overhead as a large number of peers would need to be queried to find a particular subset of matching metadata. We can mediate that in a few ways. First, our clients could take advantage of the embedded social network to cache and rehost other peer's trees --- either in their entirety or as shards distributed among other peers --- depending on our relationship to them. Second, when making links, we could notify relevant and subscribed peers that we have made it (eg. see {% cite capadisliLinkedDataNotifications2017 %}). Combined with distributed caching, that would allow the peer responsible for the schema to direct queries to peers already known to have a particular kind of file: eg. the `@nwb` peer could track when `@nwb` datasets are declared.

We don't necessarily *want* to have an entirely autonomous protocol though, following the example of wikis and bittorrent trackers we want social systems for shared governance and maintenace of the system. Trackers first serve the technical need of indexing a particular community's data, eg. as [`@dandihub`](https://hub.dandiarchive.org) does with `@nwb`, in case peers go offline. We don't want to just track datasets, however, we want to track the many different kinds of metadata in our swarm. The second role of trackers is collective curation and negotiation over schema. 

Say a group of my colleagues and I organize to set up a server as our tracker. As an interface, our tracker might allow us to browse schemas as a tree. For a given node, we might see "horizontally" across all the schemas that have modifications or extensions to that node, and "vertically" up and down their parent and children nodes. We notice that our colleague has made an extension to a schema that looks very similar to ours. We do a `diff` to see which nodes are similar and which are different between our schema. Both of us have some good ideas that the other doesn't have, so we open a conversation thread by creating a node that references both of our schemas as candidates for merging and send it to our colleague. We negotiate over a way to resolve their differences, similar to a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests), and then `merge` them. Part of our merging process is indicating how to change either of our existing structures to become the third merged structure, so our clients are able to handle those changes for us and the update propagates through the network.

As our tracker grows and maybe even becomes the de-facto tracker for our subdiscipline, things start becoming a bit messier. Aside from the "tree" view for browsing metadata, we've built views that help it function as a forum for threaded conversations and a wiki for organization, tracking projects, and setting policies. The durable but plastic nature of wikis is exceptionally well suited for this. From Butler, Joyce, and Pike (emphasis mine):

> Providing tools and infrastructure mechanisms that support the development and management of policies is an important part of creating social computing systems that work. [...] 
>
> When organizations invest in [collaborative] technologies, [...] their first step is often to put in place a collection of policies and guidelines regarding their use. **However, less attention is given to the policies and guidelines created by the groups that use these systems which are often left to “emerge” spontaneously.** The examples and concepts described in this paper highlight the complexity of rule formation and suggest that support should be provided to help collaborating groups create and maintain effective rulespaces.
> 
> [...] **The true power of wikis lies in the fact that they are a platform that provides affordances which allow for a wide variety of rich, multifaceted organizational structures.** Rather than assuming that rules, policies, and guidelines are operating in only one fashion, wikis allow for, and in fact facilitate, the creation of policies and procedures that serve a wide variety of functions 
>
> *Don't Look Now, But We've Created a Bureaucracy: The Nature and Roles of Policies and Rules in Wikipedia* (2008) {% cite butlerDonLookNow2008 %} 

So we might have a set of policies that encourages a reporting system to notify other peers if their data is misformatted. Or we might reward contribution with a "peer of the week" award that highlights their work like What.cd's album of the week or Wikipedia's [barnstars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Barnstars) {% cite wikipediaWikipediaBarnstars2022 %}. We might adopt a cooperative model where each peer pays their share of the server fees, or has to take shifts on moderation and cleanup duty for the week. Each tracker can adopt different policies to reflect their communities. 

Trackers-as-wikis don't have to exist in isolation. Trackers for adjacent disciplines or purposes should be able to federate together to transclude pages: organizing multiple perspectives on the same topic, or supplementing each other into a broader base of knowledge.

What if consensus fails? Our system attempts to mitigate the potential damage of tyrannical moderators by making it extremely easy to *fork.* Since every link in the system "belong" to someone underneath a `@namespace`, links and the schemas they build are always a proposition: "something someone said that I don't necessarily have to agree with." If another peer doesn't like the `merge` that we did, they can fork the previous version and continue using it --- for other peers the link to the merged version lets them translate between them. If we want to jump ship and go find a different tracker that better reflects our values, all our data, including relationships to the people that we liked there, guides we wrote on the wiki, etc. are still our own. The tracker just tracks, it isn't a platform.

Our joint tracker-wikis have many applications for scientific communication, and it's worth exploring a few.

Continuing the example of the Autopilot wiki, we could make an array of **technical knowledge wikis.** Wikis organized around individual projects could federate together to share information, and broader wikis could organize the state of our art which currently exists hollowed out in supplemental methods sections. The endless stream of posts asking around for whoever knows how to do some technique that should be basic knowledge for a given discipline illustrate the need. Organizing the technical knowledge that is mostly hard-won by early career researchers without robust training mechanisms would dramatically change their experience in science, whittling away at inequities in access to expertise. Their use only multiplies with tools that are capable of using the semantically organized information to design interface or simplify their operation as described in [experimental frameworks](#experimental-frameworks).

Technical wikis could change the character of technical work. By giving a venue for technical workers to describe their work, they would be welcomed into and broaden the base of credit currently reserved only for paper authors. Even without active contribution, they would be a way of describing the unseen iceberg of labor that science rests on. Institutional affiliations are currently just badges of prestige, but they could also represent the dependence of scientific output on the workers of that institution. If I do animal research at a university, and someone has linked to the people responsible for maintaining the animal facility, then they should be linked to all of my work. Making technical knowledge broadly available might also be a means of inverting the patronizing approach to "crowdsourcing" "citizen science" by putting it directly in the hands of nonscientists, rather than at the whim of some gamified platform.

Technical wikis blend smoothly into **methods wikis** for cataloguing best practices in experimental design and analysis. It is a damning indictment of our systems of training or review (or, more likely, both) that it is possible to publish a paper with a misused t-test, yet the scientific literature is flooded with errors {% cite strasakStatisticalErrorsMedical2007 brownIssuesDataAnalyses2018 leekStatisticsValuesAre2015 %}. The cause of analytical errors is not just a matter of lack of education, with a complex network of incentives and disciplinary subcultures. Combined with the ability to survey and contextualize the array of analytical techniques for a given body of data as described in [analytical frameworks](#analytical-frameworks), methods wikis could at least identify and bring to light the state of a discipline's art. 

Analysis wikis would also be a natural means of organizing the previously mentioned Folding@Home-style distributed computing grids. Groups of researchers could organize computational resources and govern and document their use. Since the kind of wikis we are describing combine free text with computer-readable data structures, policies for use could be directly implemented in the wiki in the same place they were discussed. This too is a means of collectivizing support for open-source initiatives that support basic infrastructure by donation and the mercy of cloud providers by integrating them in the basic social practices of science {% cite dupreAdvertisingNewInfrastructures2022 %}.

**Review wikis** could replace journals, almost as an afterthought. 






- Applications
  - Organizing peer review and regulating annotations, comments, and "status" of documents.
    - This neatly replaces journals as such, and the fact that it's one tiny piece of the infrastructural system should give some indication of how badly they serve science.
    - renewed role for librarians in organizing knowledge. librarians have bemoaned the bad tooling for managing metadata and this would also serve htem.
  - Theory wiki
    - mix of multivalent documents, wiki pages, discussions, public wiki pages from eg. "publisher-like" things that are more communally edited and be linked to the same underlying body of information and argument without making assumptions about the form of the discussion.




---



For example, we briefly mentioned a Folding@Home-like system of donated computing resources, and separately described embedding analyses in a forum by calling our own compute resources. Together, a tracker could implement a compute ratio where to use shared computing resources you need to contribute a certain amount of your own. The bounty system where peers would donate their excess upload in exchange for uploading a rare album on what.cd could translate to one where someone who has donated a lot of excess compute time could donate it for someone uploading or collecting a particular dataset. 

Another tracker more focused on sharing and reviewing results might make a review ratio system, where for every review your work receives you need to review n other works. This would effectively function as a **reviewer co-op** that can make the implicit labor of reviewing explicit, and develop systems for tying the reviews required for frequent publication with explicit norms around reciprocal reviewing. 

Forum and feedlike media are good for organizing continuous conversation, but wikis serve as a more durable knowledge store for cumulative reference information. We don't need to imagine wikis as being text-only, with wiki formatting used just to change the appearance of text, but as a means of declaring and manipulating semantic links. For example, [Semantic MediaWiki](https://www.semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Semantic_MediaWiki) is an extension to Wikipedia's wiki system that extends `[[Wikilinks]]` to be able to declare semantic links like `[[linkType::Target]]`. For example, if our project had a wiki page like `[[My Project]]` we could say it `[[hasType::@analysis:project]]` and `[[usesDataset::@jonny:mydata1]]` etc. These wikis have the capability to not only organize knowledge, but also serve as a flexible means of declaring new programming interfaces and assigning credit. 


The same combination of trackers, forums, and wikis has a natural application to analysis pipelines. Ideally, to move beyond fragile code reduplicated in every lab, we need some means of reaching consensus on a few canonical implementations of fundamental analysis operations. Given a system where analysis chains are linked to the formats and subdisciplines they are used with, we can map a semantically dense map of the analysis paths used in a research domain. In neurophysiology: "What are the different ways spikes are extracted and analyzed from extracellular electrophysiology recordings?" Having the ability to discuss and contextualize different analytical methods elevates all the exasperated methods critiques and exhortations to "not use this statistically unsound technique" into something *structurally expressed in the practice of science.* See all the `@neurotheory` threads about this specific analysis chain, or the `@methodswiki` page that summarizes this general category of techniques.

We're now in a place where we can address the problem of a cumulative knowledge system for science directly. In many (most?) scientific epistemologies, scientific results do not directly reflect some truth about reality, but instead instead are embedded in a system of meaning through a process of active interpretation (eg. {% cite meehlTheoreticalRisksTabular1978 %}). The interpretation of every scientific result is left as the responsibility of the authors to recreate and a few reviewers to evaluate, which would be a monumental amount of labor given the velocity of papers, so researchers do the best they can engaging with a small amount of research. Since the space of argumentation is built from scratch each time from incomplete information, there's no guarantee of making cumulative progress on a shared set of theories, and most fall far from the supposed ideal of hard refutation and can have long lives as "zombie theories." van Rooij and Baggio describe the "collecting seashells" approach of gathering many results and leaving the theory for later with an analogy:

> "In a sense, trying to build theories on collections of effects is much like trying to write novels by collecting sentences from randomly generated letter strings. Indeed, each novel ultimately consists of strings of letters, and theories should ultimately be compatible with effects. Still, the majority of the (infinitely possible) effects are irrelevant for the aims of theory building, just as the majority of (infinitely possible) sentences are irrelevant for writing a novel." {% cite vanrooijTheoryTestHow2021 %}

They and others (eg. {% cite guestHowComputationalModeling2021 %}) have argued for an iterative process of experiments informed by theory and modeling that confirm or constrain future models. Their articulation of the need for multiple registers of formality and rigidity is particularly resonant here. van Rooij and Baggio again:

> "The first sketch of an f need not be the final one; what matters is how the initial f is constrained and refined and how the rectification process can actually drive the theory forward. Theory building is a creative process involving a dialectic of divergent and convergent thinking, informal and formal thinking." {% cite vanrooijTheoryTestHow2021 %}

Let's turn our provenance chain into a circle: a means of linking theories to analytical results and interpretation as well as experimental design and tooling. Say the theorists have a wiki. They start making some loose schematic descriptions of their theories and linking them to different experimental results that constrain, affirm, refute, or otherwise interact with them. These could be forward or backlinks: declared by the original author or by someone else describing their results. 

In the most optimistic case, where we have a full provenance chain from analytical results back through experimental practice, we have a means of formally evaluating the empirical contingencies that serve as the evidence for scientific theories. For a given body of experimental data bearing on a theoretical question, what kinds of evidence exist? As the state of the art in analytical tooling changes, how are the interpretations of prior results changed by different analyses? How do different experimental methodologies influence the form of our theories? The points of conflicting evidence and unevaluated predictions of theory are then a means of distributed coordination of future experiments: guided by a distributed body of evidence and interpretation, rather than the amount of the literature base individual researchers are able to hold in mind, what are the most informative experiments to do?

The pessimistic case where we only have scientific papers in their current form to evaluate is not that much worse --- it requires the normal reading and evaluation of experimental results of a review paper, but the process of annotating the paper to describe its experimental and analytical methods as a shared body of links makes that work cumulative. Even more pessimistic, where for some reason we aren't able to formulate theories even as rough schematics but just link experimental results to rough topic domains is still vastly better than the current state of disorganization and proprietary indices. 

For both researchers and the public at large a meta-organization of experimental results changes the way we interact with scientific literature. It currently takes many years of implicit knowledge to understand any scientific subfield: finding canonical papers, knowing which researchers to follow, which keywords to search in table of contents alerts. Being able to find a collection of papers about an object of research, as well as the conversations at all levels of formality that contextualize them --- to say nothing of building a world without paywalls --- would profoundly lower barriers to access to primary scientific knowledge for *everyone.* 

It is worth pausing to compare a world where we boisterously and fluidly organize knowledge explicitly as a collective project of understanding with one where knowledge organization is weaponized into a product that lets us get ahead of our competitors without necessarily improving our understanding of the body of scientific literature. One sounds like science, the other sounds like industry capture.

All the technological-social tools described here are not a definitive set of tools needed for scientific communications infrastructure, but *examples of interfaces to a linked data system.* Using JSON-LD notebooks to enable us to embed links in our writing to be mentioned or transcluded elsewhere. Using a forum as a means of creating linked discussions about experimental results and analyses. Using linked microblogging tools for a rapid, informal means of organizing and discussing knowledge. Using all of the above to represent the many expressions of a work across multiple linked namespaces. Using annotation tools to create anchors and links for referencing links in other communication media. Using tracker-like and wiki-like systems to interact with, negotiate about, and govern a wily body of autonomously declared links.

Each is intended to be mutable, easy to iterate on, uncontrolling, mutually coordinated. Each interacts with and augments the previously described systems for shared data, analytical, and experimental tools. The purpose of this section is not to advocate a specific set of technologies, but to describe a base layer of familiar technologies for an indefinite future of possible interfaces for representing and interacting with a body of shared knowledge. 

What we've described is a nonutopian, fully realizable path to making a scientific system that is fully negotiable through the entire theoretical-empirical loop with minor development of existing tools and minimal adjustment of scientific practices. No clouds, no journals, a little rough around the edges but collectively owned by all scientists.
