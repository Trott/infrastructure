We can't expect the entire practice of academic publishing to transition to cell-based text editors in a p2p linked data swarm anytime soon. In the same way that we discussed frameworks for integrating heterogeneous analytical and experimental tools, we need some means of **bridging** communication tools and **overlays** for interacting with communication formats. There are many examples of bridging communication protocols, eg. the [many ways to use Matrix](https://matrix.org/bridges/) with [Slack](https://matrix.org/bridges/#slack), [email](https://matrix.org/bridges/#email), [Signal](https://matrix.org/bridges/#signal), etc. The overlays for websites, pdfs, and other more static media that we'll discuss are means to bring them into the system whether they support it or not: our interoperability should be willing to be adversarial if it needs to be {% cite doctorowAdversarialInteroperabilityReviving2019 doctorowAdversarialInteroperability2019 %}. In representing the intrinsically interactive and social nature of reading (eg. see {% cite jacksonMarginaliaReadersWriting2001 %}), overlays as interfaces also supplement the "horizontal" connections between cells by injecting information into them or transcluding it elsewhere: creating a fuzzy boundary between writing *on* something vs *about* something. 

We don't need to look far to find a well-trod interface for annotation overlays for document-like media: the humble highlighter. [Hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is), enabled on this page, lets readers highlight and annotate any webpage with a [browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hypothesis-web-pdf-annota/bjfhmglciegochdpefhhlphglcehbmek) or javascript bookmarklet. This interface is quasi-identical to the highlighting and review tools of Microsoft Word and Google Docs used for the same purpose. At its heart is a system for making anchors, references to specific places in a text, and the means of matching them even when the text changes or the reference is ambiguous {% cite csillagFuzzyAnchoring2013 %}. For example, [this anchor](https://hypothes.is/a/oLw4uk7_Eeyt5N-FVlE3fw) has three features, a `RangeSelector` that anchors it given the position within the paragraph, an absolute `TextPositionSelector`, and a contextual `TextQuoteSelector` that you can see with an [API call](https://api.hypothes.is/api/annotations/oLw4uk7_Eeyt5N-FVlE3fw)[^anchorapi]. These anchors could be the objects to which we could link from the rest of our communication system.

On its own, it serves to give a `Talk:` page to every website. With an integration into a system of linked data and identity, it also serves as a means of extending the notion of bidirectional transclusion described above to work that is not explicitly formatted for it. Most scientific work is represented as `.pdf`s rather than `.html` pages, and hypothes.is [already supports](https://web.hypothes.is/help/annotating-locally-saved-pdfs/) annotating PDFs. With an integration into pdf reading software, for example [Zotero's PDF reader](https://www.zotero.org/support/pdf_reader_preview), there would be a relatively low barrier to integrating collaborative annotation into existing workflows and practices.

Digital publishing makes imagining the social regulation of science as a much more broadly based and continuous process much easier, but the problem of moderation remains (as it has since at least the coiner of the terms "Gold" and "Green" open access lost faith in ahierarchical scientific communication after someone said poo-poo words at him on Internet while defending the use of they/them as gender-ambiguous pronouns {% cite harnadSkyWriting1987 harnadScholarlySkywritingPrepublication1990 ellisBooksTranslationWanted1986 %}). Some movement has been made towards public peer review: eLife has integrated hypothes.is since 2016 {% cite ELifePartnersHypothes2016 %}, and bioRxiv had decided to integrate it as well in 2017 {% cite dwhlyBioRxivSelectsHypothesis2017 %} before getting cold feet about the genuinely hard problem of moderation (among others {% cite heatherstainesPreprintServicesGather2018 %}) and instead adopting the more publisher-friendly TRiP system of refereed peer-reviews {% cite nateangellAnnouncingTRiPTransparent2019 %}.

Overlays raise basic questions about control over the representation of our work, about who is able to write what on it. As with potential incompatibility between interfaces, we should be able to control what comments appear *on* our work, but there is no way to control -- even in our current communication systems -- what someone says *about* it. Our system gives us some ability to identify bad actors and regulate the avenues of communication without overcorrecting into a system where criticism becomes impossible -- even if we don't want to represent someone's comments on our work, it is possible to make them and for others to find them, but it's also possible to contextualize their context if they're made in bad faith. 

Though a description of the norms and tools needed to maintain healthy public annotation is impossible here, our system *provides a space for having that conversation.* Authors could, for example, allow the display of annotations from a professional society like `@sfn` that has a code of conduct and moderation team, or annotations associated with comments on `@pubpeer`, or from a looser organization of colleagues and other `@neurofriends`. Conversely, being able to make annotations and comments from different federations gives us a rough proxy to different registers of communication and preserves the plurality of our expression. Social tools like these are in the hypothes.is team's [development roadmap](https://web.archive.org/web/20211015213849/https://github.com/hypothesis/product-backlog/projects/6), but I intend it as a well-developed and mature example of a general type of technology[^genius] rather than a recommendation. 

In addition to annotating other works, overlays can come in the form of bots or other tools for interacting with existing systems in a way that's compatible with a new one. One particularly impressive example of aggressive interoperability in this domain is [`@flancian`](https://flancia.org/)'s [anagora](https://anagora.org/). An agora is a [wiki-like](https://anagora.org/wiki-like) project with pages for each named concept (or node), but it also allows for multiple representations of a given node: so notes from multiple people will be present on the same page, but also links from multiple mediums. Accompanying the agora is the anagora bot (on [Mastodon](https://botsin.space/@agora) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/an_agora)), which makes links to, and backlinks from pages mentioned as `[[wikilinks]]` by accounts that follow them (for example: a [post](https://social.coop/@jonny/108621001205679783), the bot's [reply](https://botsin.space/@agora/108621001318792297), and one of the linked pages, [`[[wikilinks everywhere]]`](https://anagora.org/Wikilinks+Everywhere)).
