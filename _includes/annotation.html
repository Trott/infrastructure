		This page embeds <a href="https://hypothes.is">hypothes.is</a>, which allows you to annotate the text!
        Existing annotations should show up highlighted like this,
        and you can make a new annotation by highlighting an area of the text and clicking the 'annotate' button that appears! You can see all annotations by opening the sidebar on the right.

	<p>
		To ask a question or make a comment about the document as a whole, we can use the 'page notes' feature sort of like a chatroom. Open the sidebar at the right, and click the 'page notes' tab at the top.
