		This page embeds <a href="https://hypothes.is">hypothes.is</a>, which allows you to annotate the text!
        Existing annotations should show up highlighted like this,
        and you can make a new annotation by highlighting an area of the text and clicking the 'annotate' button that appears! You can see all annotations by opening the sidebar on the right.
