		This page embeds <a href="https://hypothes.is">hypothes.is</a>, which allows you to annotate the text!
        Existing annotations should show up highlighted like this,
        and you can make a new annotation by highlighting an area of the text and clicking the 'annotate' button that appears! You can see all annotations by opening the sidebar on the right.
	</p>
	<p>
		Unfortunately, hypothes.is causes the page to freeze on load currently (especially on mobile). I've submitted an issue: <a href="https://github.com/hypothesis/client/issues/3919">https://github.com/hypothesis/client/issues/3919</a>

		If you do work that you think is relevant here but I am not citing it, it's 99% likely that's because I haven't read it, not that I'm deliberately ignoring you! Feel free to annotate any missing citations, odds are I'd love to read & cite your work, and if you're working in the same space try and join efforts!

		We've made it to the end of the document! There are plenty of places with placeholder text and extra plenty editing to do, but we're almost there!
