*This is a draft document, so if you do work that you think is relevant here but I am not citing it, it's 99% likely that's because I haven't read it , not that I'm deliberately ignoring you! Odds are I'd love to read & cite your work, and if you're working in the same space try and join efforts!*

> In building cyberinfrastructure, the key question is not whether a problem is a “social” problem or a “technical” one. That is putting it the wrong way around. The question is whether we choose, for any given problem, a primarily social or a technical solution
