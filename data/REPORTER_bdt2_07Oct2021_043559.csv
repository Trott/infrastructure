Background
The current release of CAMP FHIR reads clinical data stored in either the i2b2/ACT or PCORnet common data
models, converts those data to custom database views built to align with the FHIR R4 specification, and
produces JSON-formatted FHIR files on demand. See Figure 1 for an overview of the CAMP FHIR data flow.
Figure 1. Data flow through
CAMP FHIR to produce a
JSON-formatted FHIR file (the
Patient resource, in this
example) from CDM-format
data. This example uses
i2b2/ACT as a source;
PCORnet may also be used.
The resulting FHIR files are in a “bulk” format (i.e., CAMP FHIR’s MedicationRequest output will contain the
FHIR-formatted medication records for all patients in the cohort), and can be consumed by any number of
downstream applications.
Value to the Scientific Community
Mapping an individual clinical data model to FHIR is resource intensive; collaborating institutions may have
“mismatched” data models (in terms of model, version, or both); and new data models will likely continue to
emerge. Thus, there are many sustainability benefits to consolidating around a single data model, or at the
very least providing software to support such consolidation where it is desired.
 CAMP FHIR may also help to address some of the barriers that are currently preventing wider uptake
of FHIR as a clinical data standard for research. CAMP FHIR bridges the gap between the relational model
and FHIR’s serialized format, allowing the user to work with the same data in either or both structures.
Because it does not require access to the EHR itself, but rather works off of research data models, CAMP
FHIR allows research teams that do not have EHR access to use FHIR all the same. Further, as research
informatics work often involves analyzing records for large cohorts of patients, CAMP FHIR allows research
informatics teams to use a structure akin to “bulk” FHIR before the finalized bulk FHIR standard is available.
When the bulk FHIR standard is finalized, CAMP FHIR output will be able to combine seamlessly with “native”
FHIR output from EHR bulk FHIR API endpoints.
 Use of an industry standard like FHIR as a meta-model could also encourage new data sharing
opportunities, such as collaborations between academic medical centers and community hospitals. As EHRs
increasingly adopt FHIR as a standard for data transmission, non-academic clinical organizations are more
likely to produce FHIR-formatted data from their EHR than they are to stand up an instance of i2b2, PCORnet,
or OMOP, which are more commonly found at academic medical centers. The ability to combine CAMP FHIR
output with native FHIR could thus help to democratize the opportunity to participate in data-driven clinical
research.
SA1: Harden CAMP FHIR by implementing additional software development best practices.
To ensure that CAMP FHIR is not only useful, but robust and sustainable, additional resources would allow us
to implement a variety of software engineering best practices within CAMP FHIR’s source code.
➢ Implement formal unit testing. To ensure reliability, we will implement JUnit, a Java unit testing platform. We
will perform unit testing on the current version of CAMP FHIR and develop a standard operating procedure
(SOP) for unit testing for future updates and versions. As part of implementing this SOP, we will deploy a
continuous integration (CI) server in order to automate builds and unit tests.
➢ Improve logging. Currently, troubleshooting CAMP FHIR errors requires reading through a stack-trace,
which can make identifying and resolving bugs difficult. We aim to improve logging with descriptive, easy to
interpret error messages to assist developers and users with problem solving.
➢ Improve version control and documentation. We use GitHub for CAMP FHIR version control today, but do
not leverage several Git features (e.g., tagged releases, community-submitted pull requests, Wiki
documentation) that would enable community contribution and better organization. Version control is
particularly important for CAMP FHIR, which not only has its own versions, but also supports multiple versions
of FHIR and each common data model. Leveraging multiple branches and versioned releases will enable us to,
for example, concurrently support multiple versions of CAMP FHIR to accommodate multiple versions of FHIR.
SA2: Improve interoperability by adding support for bidirectional data transformation and new
high-value FHIR resources.
➢ Enable bidirectional data conversion. We will add functionality to support bidirectional data conversion to
CAMP FHIR, meaning that users could start with a CDM and convert to FHIR, or start with FHIR files and
convert to populated CDM tables (See Figure 2). Supporting bidirectional data conversion would enable (1) the
ability to transform from one CDM to FHIR, and then back to another CDM (e.g., i2b2 -> FHIR -> PCORnet)
without having to write custom Extract – Transform – Load (ETL) jobs and (2) the ability to consume FHIR data
from partner sites with no CDM infrastructure and transform those data into a CDM supported by other project
sites for further analysis.
Figure 2. Proposed bidirectional data flow through CAMP FHIR to produce FHIR files from a CDM, or a CDM
from FHIR files.
➢ Add functionality to support additional FHIR resources and fields. CAMP FHIR currently supports the
following FHIR resources: Patient, Encounter, Condition, Procedure, Observation, and MedicationRequest.
Within each of these resources, CAMP FHIR supports a subset of the available fields that align with the
content of the supported CDMs. To maximize interoperability, we will add functionality to support additional
resources (e.g., MedicationAdministration, Claim, Location), as well as add a more streamlined mechanism for
new resources and fields to be added to the application as FHIR changes and updates with time.
➢ Validate existing and future variable and vocabulary mappings. CAMP FHIR relies on variable and
vocabulary mappings in order to convert from CDM to FHIR (and vice-versa). It is crucial that these mappings
are accurate and well-documented in order to ensure faithful data translation. We will re-examine existing
mappings to ensure they remain up to date with the newest versions of the i2b2/ACT and PCORnet data
models, and will develop an SOP for validation and documentation of all future mappings.
SA3: Improve usability and accessibility by developing a graphical user interface, adding support for
new input types, and ensuring cloud-readiness.
➢ Deploy a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The current version of CAMP FHIR is a command-line application.
Adding a simple GUI will make CAMP FHIR accessible to users who may be less comfortable using the
command line.
➢ Add support for CSV data sources. We recognize that not all clinical data are accessible via a database,
and can instead exist as flat files, such as comma-separated values (CSV). We intend to expand the data
source input options for CAMP FHIR to include CSV files to broaden users’ ability to use CAMP FHIR to
transform data into FHIR.
➢ Dockerize to ensure cloud readiness. Currently, CAMP FHIR exists as a locally installed executable. We will
transform CAMP FHIR into a cloud-ready application by producing a Dockerized version that can be deployed
on any platform (including but not limited to cloud environments provisioned via the NIH STRIDES initiative).
We will test the Dockerized instance on UNC cloud environments, in addition to NIH cloud environments.

The National Center for Data to Health (CD2H) is an informatics coordination effort to generate methods,
technologies and approaches to support network research across the CTSAs. The Pediatric COVID-19
DREAM Challenge will ask community participants to predict severity status in children, using the National
COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. The desired outcome for this
challenge is to produce trained and validated pediatric COVID-19 severity prediction models that can be
implemented into a clinical workflow in an EHR to help facilitate appropriate treatment.","NCATS","10464821","9/24/2021 12:00:00 AM","PA-20-272","3U24TR002306-05S1","3","U24","TR","002306","05","S","MISQUITTA, LEONIE","9/25/2021 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2022 12:00:00 AM","ZTR1(01)"," ","1869835","HAENDEL, MELISSA A","CHUTE, CHRISTOPHER G; EICHMANN, DAVID A.; WILCOX, ADAM BENJAMIN","06","BIOSTATISTICS & OTHER MATH SCI","041096314","US","39.708143","-104.724958","1199905","UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER","Aurora","CO","SCHOOLS OF PUBLIC HEALTH","800452571","UNITED STATES","N","9/25/2021 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2022 12:00:00 AM","350","Other Research-Related","2021","96811"," ","NCATS","84111","12700","Reg-CV","96811",

solution to openly share otherwise sensitive patient data that have been integrated with public
environmental exposures data of relevance to the COVID-19 pandemic. As an open framework
