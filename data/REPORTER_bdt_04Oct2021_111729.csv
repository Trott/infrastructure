source that will analyze and hypothesize novel relationships and interactions driven by researcher
data together with the wealth of knowledge as captured by the Biomedical Data Translator project.
The capability to bring together different biomedical data knowledge sources, including
experimental data, in order to discover yet unknown relationships has been difficult to realize. The
fundamental gap lies in a lack of rigorous and robust framework for linking or creating
sophisticated lattices of relationships needed for different lines of evidence from heterogeneous
knowledge sources. Such a framework must address systematic and mathematically driven
algorithms for hypotheses exploration, construction, and assessment in order to bridge gaps,
derive, and ultimately discover new knowledge beyond existing sources by assessing existing
molecular relationships and generating additional actionable pathway information that can be
queried directly or via API. A critical feature of a successful framework must include formal, welldefined
mechanisms for sensitivity analyses (measures of fragility and reliability of constructed
hypothesis), impact analyses (measures of importance and knowledge novelty), and parsimony
analyses (wholistic measures of congruence of hypotheses). Lastly, the functional mechanism
behind newly derived knowledge must be invertible and provide an unambiguous, precise,
auditable provenance from the original knowledge sources serving as the basis for explainability.
To realize this vision, PHK will employ a mature AI knowledge representation called Bayesian
Knowledge Bases (BKBs). BKBs model knowledge, relationships, and uncertainty within a
rigorous graph-based probabilistic framework capable of managing inconsistent, incomplete, and
cyclic knowledge. It fully subsumes a variety of well-known models including (dynamic) Bayesian
networks and temporal representations such as hidden Markov models. BKBs can be learned
from data but its most critical contribution is the ability to fuse multiple BKBs and their underlying
distributions without any loss of information. This inherently provides end-to-end forward to
backward auditability of computational derivations which admits ready sensitivity, contribution,
and impact analysis. This further leads to a formal mechanism to explore, discover, and create
new hypotheses that links multiple heterogenous knowledge sources. PHK will provide a rich AI
ready encoding of data, information, and knowledge from any number of new and existing sources
including curated databases (e.g., NIH Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)) and raw experimental
data. PHK’s encoding enables additional knowledge augmentation through probabilistic and
statistical inferencing capabilities. This augmentation is further enhanced through knowledge
unification and fusion algorithms closely coupling disparate knowledge in a well-defined, rigorous
manner. Altogether, PHK can systematically discover and develop novel hypotheses. BKBs have
been applied and deployed across a number of projects for over two decades with a mature
software base for ready integration into the Translator framework’s target prototypes.
Our multi-institutional team (Dartmouth College, Tufts University Clinical and Translational
Sciences Institute (CTSI)) is comprised of senior researchers and software engineers in the
computer and data sciences, cheminformatics, bioinformatics, molecular biology, and
biochemistry. Dr. Eugene Santos Jr. is Professor of Engineering at Dartmouth. He will serve as
the PI and will also lead in the technical development of the core BKB component for PHK.
Joseph Gormley is the Director for Advanced Systems Development for Tufts/CTSI. He will serve
as Project Manager for all software deliverables under this proposal.
The PHK capabilities proposed herein will also be based on strategies developed by our team
for scalable intelligent information retrieval where the desire for greater transparency when
reasoning over experimental data is a primary aim. PHK will provide a powerful new
computational representation of pathway structures and molecular components in support of both
human and machine-driven interpretation and pathway-based biomarker discovery and drug
development. PHK will enable more efficient joint human-machine exploration with explanation.",666063

team (“Team X-ray”) at Oregon State University (PI Stephen Ramsey) and at two partner
institutions, Pennsylvania State University (PI Koslicki) and the Institute for Systems Biology
(PI Eric Deutsch; Co-I Jared Roach). Team X-ray was highly productive in Translator's feasibility
assessment phase and the team brings critical expertise to Translator (see Resources).
Component type: We propose to create, validate, and integrate an autonomous relay agent
(ARA) called ARAX . ARAX will be a middleware component in the new Translator architecture
that will extend significantly beyond the capabilities of the prototype reasoning tool (RTX) that
we created in the feasibility assessment phase. Depending on the input request, ARAX's main
output will be ranked subgraphs with clearly explained ranking basis. ARAX will leverage code
and algorithms from RTX and will have an explicit application focus area, as described below.
Main problems that ARAX is trying to address: Connections within a biomedical knowledge
graph have highly variable degrees of (i) confidence (due to ambiguous predicates and/or due
to highly variable degrees of reliability of knowledge types) and (ii) potential relevance to the
user's query. Such edge-significance variability leads to both incorrect and difficult-to-interpret
results which together pose a significant problem for creating broadly useful tools for
computer-based biomedical reasoning. We propose to address this problem by explicitly
accounting for these two types of edge variability in the reasoning algorithms–spanning a broad
range of biomedical query types–that ARAX will provide to Translator. In addition to these broad
capabilities, as described in the Project Plan, we will incorporate advanced algorithms in ARAX
for responding to queries relating to disease therapy, including (1) drug repositioning for known
disease, leveraging knowledge about the disease’s pathogenesis [1] ; and (2) therapeutic
recommendations for rare diseases based on symptoms and the putative causal genetic variant.
Plan for implementation of the project: In our Project Plan we describe a five-year timeline for
creating, validating, and integrating ARAX within Translator, beginning with a three-month sprint
leading to a prototype of ARAX by mid-March 2020. Key components of the plan include: (1)
leveraging the BioThings Explorer software framework to enable ARAX to dynamically map
between compounds, proteins, pathways, variants, phenotypes, and diseases based on
knowledge source application programming interfaces in the Translator registry; (2) leveraging
COHD and related Translator resources to obtain biomedical semantic distance information;
(3) leveraging an application programming interface endpoint for the RTX biomedical knowledge
graph, KG2; and (4) implementing probabilistic reasoning algorithms leveraging provenance
information and dynamically determined edge relevance scores to improve reasoning. We will
systematically use machine-learning to align ranking scores with measures of output quality.
Collaboration strengths of our team include (i) developing technical standards for
communications between Translator software agents (leveraging PI Deutsch’s extensive past
experience); (ii) developing knowledge graph standards (leveraging PI Ramsey’s and PI
Koslicki’s expertise); and (iii) deriving use-case vignettes that speak to the transformative
potential of Translator (leveraging Co-I Roach’s and PI Ramsey’s expertise). In the development
phase, our team would continue to collaborate with other teams and with NIH stakeholders in an
adaptive, high-bandwidth, and team-boundary-agnostic fashion, as detailed in the Project Plan.
Key challenges to building the proposed system are (1) the need to be able to ""chain"" together
analytical steps between tools and (2) the need for cooperative development of standards that
enable Translator components to interact; we address them in detail in the Project Plan.",897051

based on molecular and cellular abnormalities. While many experimental approaches exist to
interrogate molecular or cellular processes, few can discern which among a host of potential
abnormalities are relevant to disease in the human system. Genetic variants associated with
disease are unique in providing molecular alterations causally related to human disease risk.
There are two types of genetic associations. Rare disease associations can (usually) be
clearly linked to a gene and are well represented by catalogs such as ClinVar, OMIM, and
Monarch. Complex disease associations are harder to interpret because they (a) are statistical
rather than qualitative and (b) usually lie in noncoding genomic regions that cannot be
immediately translated to molecular or cellular abnormalities. Many complementary resources to
help in the biological translation of complex disease associations have recently emerged,
broadly classifiable as either “functional genomic” datasets (e.g. from epigenomic profiling or
chromatin capture) or predictive bioinformatic methods (e.g. that integrate various genetic and
functional genomic datasets to predict disease-susceptibility genes or pathways). These
resources require expertise to curate and interpret, and there is as yet no knowledge source
that integrates them to interpret complex disease associations. Furthermore, techniques for
harmonizing heterogeneous functional genomic datasets with respect to one another are not yet
established, most predictive bioinformatic methods specify complex data-processing pipelines
that have not yet been scaled to run across many diseases, and there are few if any “gold
standards” to evaluate the molecular or cellular abnormalities identified by these resources.
The goal of our proposed project is to address these gaps within a complex
disease genetics Knowledge Provider for Translator. We are experts in complex disease
genetics and maintain the Knowledge Portal Network (KPN), a collection of open source web
portals and Smart APIs that make integrated genetic and genomic datasets publicly accessible
for >180 complex diseases. We have built the KPN by developing a protocol for working with
disease experts to aggregate and curate high-confidence genetic datasets, building
computational pipelines to harmonize these data and apply predictive bioinformatic methods
upon them, and extracting relationships mined from these data into a Neo4J graph database.
We propose to use the KPN as a foundation to implement a Translator Knowledge Provider of
high-confidence complex disease associations and predicted disease-relevant molecular and
cellular abnormalities. We will implement this Knowledge Provider by (a) expanding the data
sources, data types, and bioinformatic methods integrated within the KPN; (b) developing new
computational algorithms to improve the ability of genetic data to identify molecular and cellular
abnormalities underlying complex disease; (c) maintaining REST services provisioning
Translator with these resources; and (d) developing methodologies for evaluating the accuracy
and internal consistency of these data, further curating them, and defining use cases of them
within Translator. In so doing, we will enable Translator users to address questions such as:
• What genes are causally linked to complex disease [X], and with what confidence?
• What is the increase in risk for complex disease [X] when gene [Y] is perturbed?
• What pathways are enriched for associations with complex disease [X]?
• What tissues mediate the pathogenesis of complex disease [X]?
• What other diseases are genetically correlated with complex disease [X]?
We participated in the Translator feasibility study and contributed important insights to the
project vision including (a) a unifying architectural model of Translator (based on interviews with
each Translator team) closely followed by OTA-19-009; (b) the concept of Translator as a tool to
augment (rather than replace) human reasoning; and (c) the idea of a “Turing test” to evaluate
Translator capabilities. Our expertise in human genetics and hypothesis-driven science, but also
computer science and computational biology, ideally positions us to collaborate with NIH staff
and other awardees to help guide Translator data integration in a scientifically rigorous manner.",493324

Component (SRI) that integrates the collaborations and investments that the NCATS Translator
has made to date. This component will consist of a suite of standards and products, a model for
their governance, and processes to coordinate integration and shared implementation:
● Community governance coordination will be developed with community buy-in to ensure
an effective collaborative environment, and drive consortium-wide consensus on the other
components.
● Architecture and API specifications will drive community efforts to define details of project
architecture and communication protocols across Translator Knowledge Providers (KPs),
Autonomous Relay Agents (ARAs), and the Autonomous Relay System (ARS).
● The BioLink model will define the standard entity types, relationship types, and a schema
shared by all Translator components. This includes related utility libraries and a novel
approach to accommodate multiple alternate data modeling perspectives.
● Integrated reference ontologies will provide BioLink-compliant terms and relationships. We
will draw on the ROBOKOP Ubergraph framework [1] , the Monarch integrated ontologies,
and other ontologies from Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) [2] .
● A continually-updated knowledge graph and data lake will provide Translator with a
standardized and integrated global view of the whole information landscape.
● Next-generation Shared Translator Services will integrate features of ROBOKOP [3] ,
Monarch [4] , BioLink [5] , and the reasoner APIs to remove integration barriers. These
services will provide validation, lookup, and mapping functionality for use across Translator.
● A registry of Translator KPs, ARAs, and shared services will increase efficiency,
eliminate duplication of effort, and promote collaboration.
2) Our proposed SRI will address the problem of connecting together different components and
data/information sources at scale, with community buy-in, and with a plan for sustainability.
3) For the development of the standards component of the SRI, our plan will begin with
accepted Translator standards, and we will work with the ARS, ARAs, and KPs to identify gaps.
We will have a community process for contributing to the standards, making use of GitHub pull
requests and voting, to help everyone contribute effectively and fairly with clear attribution. We
will ensure rigorous documentation and testing. For the reference implementation component,
we will stand up core Translator services, and will include additional services if they are useful to
more than one Translator component rather than used by only one.
4) Consensus-building is hard. Our team has proven expertise and resources to identify needs,
refine solutions, and find agreement , thereby successfully bringing infrastructure to fruition. Our
team also has the technical and biological expertise to design and test the necessary standards,
having been at the forefront of multiple ontology, data standards, and large enterprise software
initiatives.
5) The Translator infrastructure is by nature heterogeneous, distributed, and growing;
consequently, the most significant data and infrastructure challenge is managing the validity,
currency, equivalency, and typing of entities (diseases, phenotypes, drugs, etc.). Our group has
developed several innovative algorithms for managing this and related problems; these
algorithms are in use for other integration projects and will be modified to suit Translator needs.",1238040

BioLink-compatible models via high-performance text-mining of the biomedical literature.
Problems with Translator’s current mining of the biomedical literature that we intend to
solve include: (1) weaknesses in framework extensibility and benchmarking that make
integrating and validating new text-mining approaches difficult; (2) problematic licensing of
software, terminologies and other resources that do not adequately support FAIR (and TLC)
best practices; (3) processing only PubMed titles and abstracts, not full text publications; (4)
Translator’s use of older NLP technology with relatively poor performance; (5) lack of a
mechanism for community feedback regarding errors and other problems; (6) lack of continuous
updates to add knowledge from new publications; (7) output knowledge representation that is
simplistic and vague, failing to reflect the richness of what is expressed in scientific documents.
Plan for implementation: Our team has a long history of productive NLP research,
successful open source software projects, effective benchmarking and broad community
engagement. We will build on the results of NLM-funded work in information extraction, our
gold-standard Colorado Richly Annotated Full Text (CRAFT) corpus, a recent BioNLP Open
Shared Task (BioNLP-OST) that we organized, and recent advances in state-of-the-art NLP.
For Segment 1, we will: (1) Demonstrate BioStacks, an extensible, cloud-based text-mining
framework that produces knowledge graphs grounded in the Open Biomedical Ontologies
(OBOs). This BioStacks demo will include a state-of-the-art OBO concept recognizer for multiple
ontologies, a state-of-the-art semantic relationship prediction tool, and a state-of-the-art
structural analysis tool. All generated assertions will have provenance metadata linking the
assertion to a particular text span in a document specified by PMCID. (2) Demonstrate CRAFTST,
a cloud-based text-mining evaluation system that evaluates the performance of text-mining
systems against the CRAFT gold standard. (3) Demonstrate an adaptive machine learning
process illustrating how to efficiently create tools to extract BioLink association types.
For Segment 2, we propose to extend the text-mining and evaluation frameworks to align
with BioLink and the Translator community, improve text-mining quality and expand the
collection of source documents mined. Specifically, we propose to target 10 long term
milestones: (1) Align CRAFT to BioLink. (2) Develop new tools for extracting associations from
text. (3) Develop and manage a community engagement process on text-mining for Translator.
(4) Extend benchmarking. (5) Improve recall. (6) Improve precision. (7) Improve computational
efficiency. (8) Expand BioStacks to include all available full text biomedical journal articles. (9)
Expand document collections to include Patents & Regulatory filings. (10) Develop a scientist-based
movement to improve document access for text-mining from non-open publishers.
The types of questions the resulting knowledge graph can be used to address are
extremely broad, as it is generated by mining a large part of the biomedical literature.
Questions that can be answered include those about specific assertions (e.g. is this drug an
agonist-activator of this protein?), general relations (are these two proteins often mentioned
together?), and documents (which publications mention this gene, mutation and drug?).
Integration: We are long-time contributors to the open-science community and have
longstanding collaborations with existing awardees; we were participants in the NIH Data
Commons Pilot. We propose to align the output of text-mining tools to the BioLink model via
OBO terms. We propose to implement our frameworks in NIH Cloud Computing environments.
We propose to adopt the CD2H Contributor Attribution Model to foreground community
contributions. We plan to coordinate with the NLM’s nascent benchmarking activities and the
SmartAPI effort to build Translator standard interfaces.
Challenges and gaps: High-performance mining of rich, contextualized knowledge from the
literature remains a difficult task, and is unlikely to be solved in the next five years. Many
important publications remain inaccessible to text-mining due to restrictive licensing.",471239

Component (SRI) that integrates the collaborations and investments that the NCATS Translator
has made to date. This component will consist of a suite of standards and products, a model for
their governance, and processes to coordinate integration and shared implementation:
● Community governance coordination will be developed with community buy-in to ensure
an effective collaborative environment, and drive consortium-wide consensus on the other
components.
● Architecture and API specifications will drive community efforts to define details of project
architecture and communication protocols across Translator Knowledge Providers (KPs),
Autonomous Relay Agents (ARAs), and the Autonomous Relay System (ARS).
● The BioLink model will define the standard entity types, relationship types, and a schema
shared by all Translator components. This includes related utility libraries and a novel
approach to accommodate multiple alternate data modeling perspectives.
● Integrated reference ontologies will provide BioLink-compliant terms and relationships. We
will draw on the ROBOKOP Ubergraph framework [1] , the Monarch integrated ontologies,
and other ontologies from Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) [2] .
● A continually-updated knowledge graph and data lake will provide Translator with a
standardized and integrated global view of the whole information landscape.
● Next-generation Shared Translator Services will integrate features of ROBOKOP [3] ,
Monarch [4] , BioLink [5] , and the reasoner APIs to remove integration barriers. These
services will provide validation, lookup, and mapping functionality for use across Translator.
● A registry of Translator KPs, ARAs, and shared services will increase efficiency,
eliminate duplication of effort, and promote collaboration.
2) Our proposed SRI will address the problem of connecting together different components and
data/information sources at scale, with community buy-in, and with a plan for sustainability.
3) For the development of the standards component of the SRI, our plan will begin with
accepted Translator standards, and we will work with the ARS, ARAs, and KPs to identify gaps.
We will have a community process for contributing to the standards, making use of GitHub pull
requests and voting, to help everyone contribute effectively and fairly with clear attribution. We
will ensure rigorous documentation and testing. For the reference implementation component,
we will stand up core Translator services, and will include additional services if they are useful to
more than one Translator component rather than used by only one.
4) Consensus-building is hard. Our team has proven expertise and resources to identify needs,
refine solutions, and find agreement , thereby successfully bringing infrastructure to fruition. Our
team also has the technical and biological expertise to design and test the necessary standards,
having been at the forefront of multiple ontology, data standards, and large enterprise software
initiatives.
5) The Translator infrastructure is by nature heterogeneous, distributed, and growing;
consequently, the most significant data and infrastructure challenge is managing the validity,
currency, equivalency, and typing of entities (diseases, phenotypes, drugs, etc.). Our group has
developed several innovative algorithms for managing this and related problems; these
algorithms are in use for other integration projects and will be modified to suit Translator needs.",958322

based on molecular and cellular abnormalities. While many experimental approaches exist to
interrogate molecular or cellular processes, few can discern which among a host of potential
abnormalities are relevant to disease in the human system. Genetic variants associated with
disease are unique in providing molecular alterations causally related to human disease risk.
There are two types of genetic associations. Rare disease associations can (usually) be
clearly linked to a gene and are well represented by catalogs such as ClinVar, OMIM, and
Monarch. Complex disease associations are harder to interpret because they (a) are statistical
rather than qualitative and (b) usually lie in noncoding genomic regions that cannot be
immediately translated to molecular or cellular abnormalities. Many complementary resources to
help in the biological translation of complex disease associations have recently emerged,
broadly classifiable as either “functional genomic” datasets (e.g. from epigenomic profiling or
chromatin capture) or predictive bioinformatic methods (e.g. that integrate various genetic and
functional genomic datasets to predict disease-susceptibility genes or pathways). These
resources require expertise to curate and interpret, and there is as yet no knowledge source
that integrates them to interpret complex disease associations. Furthermore, techniques for
harmonizing heterogeneous functional genomic datasets with respect to one another are not yet
established, most predictive bioinformatic methods specify complex data-processing pipelines
that have not yet been scaled to run across many diseases, and there are few if any “gold
standards” to evaluate the molecular or cellular abnormalities identified by these resources.
The goal of our proposed project is to address these gaps within a complex
disease genetics Knowledge Provider for Translator. We are experts in complex disease
genetics and maintain the Knowledge Portal Network (KPN), a collection of open source web
portals and Smart APIs that make integrated genetic and genomic datasets publicly accessible
for >180 complex diseases. We have built the KPN by developing a protocol for working with
disease experts to aggregate and curate high-confidence genetic datasets, building
computational pipelines to harmonize these data and apply predictive bioinformatic methods
upon them, and extracting relationships mined from these data into a Neo4J graph database.
We propose to use the KPN as a foundation to implement a Translator Knowledge Provider of
high-confidence complex disease associations and predicted disease-relevant molecular and
cellular abnormalities. We will implement this Knowledge Provider by (a) expanding the data
sources, data types, and bioinformatic methods integrated within the KPN; (b) developing new
computational algorithms to improve the ability of genetic data to identify molecular and cellular
abnormalities underlying complex disease; (c) maintaining REST services provisioning
Translator with these resources; and (d) developing methodologies for evaluating the accuracy
and internal consistency of these data, further curating them, and defining use cases of them
within Translator. In so doing, we will enable Translator users to address questions such as:
• What genes are causally linked to complex disease [X], and with what confidence?
• What is the increase in risk for complex disease [X] when gene [Y] is perturbed?
• What pathways are enriched for associations with complex disease [X]?
• What tissues mediate the pathogenesis of complex disease [X]?
• What other diseases are genetically correlated with complex disease [X]?
We participated in the Translator feasibility study and contributed important insights to the
project vision including (a) a unifying architectural model of Translator (based on interviews with
each Translator team) closely followed by OTA-19-009; (b) the concept of Translator as a tool to
augment (rather than replace) human reasoning; and (c) the idea of a “Turing test” to evaluate
Translator capabilities. Our expertise in human genetics and hypothesis-driven science, but also
computer science and computational biology, ideally positions us to collaborate with NIH staff
and other awardees to help guide Translator data integration in a scientifically rigorous manner.",530030

clinical and translational research by permitting clinicians, nurses, biomedical researchers, and
clinical scientists to query, exploit, and contribute to a federated collection of complex and highly
disparate data with medical importance. This data federation—a “quasi-comprehensive” medical
federation—will enable interrogators to pose questions about human health and disease that
could not heretofore have been imagined. We anticipate that these analyses will increase, in
ways that are paradigm shifting, our understanding of new treatments and treatment targets,
mechanisms of disease and disease transmission, environmental triggers, opportunities for drug
repurposing, molecular candidates, and systems biology pathways.
To realize this vision, we propose a trajectory that permits the realization of such a
federation. We intend to start modestly and prototype the CBDT using the unique tools we have
been building for other informatics projects, and then iteratively improve the CBDT in
collaboration with NCATS. Ultimately, the CBDT federation will need to be socialized,
permitted, and nurtured in order to realize its full potential. Indeed, we believe that the biggest
single challenge will be establishing a governance model that permits the assembly of
information pulled from across institutions and organizations. We discuss this issue in Section
2.2.1.
The CBDT must be:
• Dynamic: regularly updated to accommodate the addition of new data and data sources;
• Agile: modifiable for uses beyond the original design and adaptable for other data analysis;
• Usable: permitting differential access and levels of access (view, edit, etc.) to the data, and
permitting use by both experts and new users with modest training;
• Rational: the data will be clinically and scientifically relevant, as well as informed by policy
and protocols, and the system will provide answers with contextual meta-data; and
• Curated: the data will have associated provenance and quality measures, including
statistical relevance where appropriate.
We envision a dynamic system that supports data ingestion and subsequent
curation, federation, and exploitation (see figure). We have assembled a
team that has a track record of interdisciplinary collaboration and development of open
source tools. We propose a demonstration project that is feasible in the 2-year
time frame, but demonstrates all of the key functionality that the final
system must possess.",822173

Reasoning Over Biomedical Objects linked in Knowledge-Oriented Pathways
(ROBOKOP)—to address, in a fully automated way, user queries that can be answered by
concurrent reasoning across Knowledge Sources (KSs) by means of a Knowledge Graph (KG).
Our proof-of-concept (POC) product, PROTOCOP, represents a generalizable solution for
reasoning across KSs to identify answers to clinical and translational research questions such as
establishing data-supported Clinical Outcomes Pathways (COPs) of drugs or pathways explaining
disease-disease interactions. PROTOCOP incorporates several KSs identified by the Translator
project (e.g., chem2bio2rdf, Biolink, Pharos), as well as additional KSs that may be of value to
the broader Translator program such as Chemotext (chemotext.mml.unc.edu), which is a publiclyavailable
webserver that mines the published literature in PubMed in the form of Medical Subject
Headings (MeSH) terms. PROTOCOP has successfully identified solutions to the initial two
translational query types: (1) genetic conditions that protect against disease; and (2) COPs for
drug-condition pairs. Over the 10-month project period, we will refine and evaluate our approach
as we move from PROTOCOP to ROBOKOP and embed it in fully operational and user-friendly
software. We will develop automated approaches to identify high-scoring connected subgraphs
that translate into well-reasoned, data-supported, biological pathways that explain drug action
and disease mechanisms and that may help elucidate new drug targets. In addition, we will
expand the set of allowable queries to include those that rely on longitudinal clinical data and
time- and geospatial-dependent socio-environmental exposures data. We expect that once
developed, ROBOKOP will enable novel, testable hypothesis generation for a number of
biomedical challenges such as drug repurposing, detection of disease comorbidities, mechanistic
interpretation of disease phenotypes in terms of underlying endotypes, and others.",882674

We used Git for distributed source code control, distributed project management, and code deployment. We implemented a blackboard-­like software module (Orangeboard) that provides a knowledge-­graph object model (including information about source database and edge types for seven different types of relationships) and the ability to load the graph into Neo4j using a high-­performance bulk­-transfer (parameterized Cypher) and protocol (Bolt). We implemented Python classes to provide RESTful querying functionality for 14 different knowledge sources (Monarch/BioLink, DisGeNET, Disease Ontology, GeneProf, miRBase, miRGate, MyGene.info, OMIM, Pathway Commons 2, Pharos, human phenotype ontology, Reactome, Monarch/SciGraph, and UniProt). We implemented client­-side HTTP request/response caching as well as non-­persistent method-­level caching in Python, to accelerate knowledge graph expansion. We implemented a BioNetExpander class that can iteratively expand a knowledge graph (in Orangeboard) from one or more seed nodes. This approach is flexible with respect to future types of queries and can accommodate future selective rules for node extension. Using BioNetExpander we are able to expand a knowledge graph from 21 seed diseases to 20,000 nodes and 800,000 relationships, in an hour. To enable path scoring, we implemented a Python class for obtaining path topological characteristics and metadata, for a given path in the Neo4j graph. We then implemented Python-­based scripts for querying for paths between genetic conditions and the 21 diseases (Q1), and for the 1,000 drug/disease pairs (Q2) in the Neo4j knowledge graph (using Cypher). We benchmarked path-­finding performance of this system and found that a typical shortest-­paths query with two fixed endpoints takes 50 ms, and thus, this approach should have low query-­response latency. In order to leverage PubMed abstract co-­occurrence information in scoring a path in the knowledge graph, we used high­-performance software (from Dr. Liang Huang’s lab) for indexing PubMed and are in the process of obtaining Normalized Google Distance (NGD) scores for pairs of genetic conditions and diseases (for Q1) and for pairs of drugs and diseases (for Q2). With the knowledge graph in hand, are in the process of refining our path­-scoring approaches for Q1 & Q2 in preparation for the POC demo.",612114

heterogeneous, and multi-source biomedical and clinical data. The primary goal of DeepLink is
to enable meaningful bidirectional translation between clinical and molecular science by closing
the interoperability gap between models and knowledge at different scales. The translator will
enhance clinical science with molecular insights from basic and translational research (e.g.
genetic variants, protein interactions, pathway functions, and cellular organization), and enable
the molecular sciences by connecting biological discoveries with their pathophysiological
consequences (e.g. diseases, signs and symptoms, pharmacological effects, physiological
systems). Fundamental differences in the language and semantics used to describe the models
and knowledge between the clinical and molecular domains results in an interoperability gap.
DeepLink will systematically and comprehensively close this gap. We will begin with the latest
technology in semantic knowledge graphs to support an extensible architecture for dynamic
data federation and knowledge harmonization. We will design a system for multi-scale model
integration that is ontology-based and will combine model execution with prior, curated
biomedical knowledge. Our design strategy will be iterative and participatory and anchored by
10 major milestones. In a series of demonstrations of DeepLink’s functions, we will address one
of the major challenges facing translational science: reproducibility of biomedical research
findings that are based on evolving molecular datasets. Reproducibility of analyses and
replication of results are central to scientific advancement. Many landmark studies have used
data that are constantly being updated, curated, and pared down over time. Our series of
demonstrations projects are designed to prototype the technology required for a scalable and
robust translator as well as the techniques we will use to close the interoperability gap for a
specific use case. The demonstration project will, itself, will be a significant and novel
contribution to science.
DeepLink will be able to answer questions that are currently enigmatic. Examples include:
- From clinicians: What is the comparative effectiveness of all the treatments for disease Y
given a patient's genetic/metabolic/proteomic profile? What are the functional variants in
cell type X that are associated with differential treatment outcomes? What metabolite
perturbations in cell type Y are associated with different subtypes of disease X?
- From basic science researchers: What is known about disease Y across all model
organisms (even those not designed to model Y)? What are all the clinical phenotypes that
result from a change in function in protein X? Which biological pathways are affected by a
pathogenic variant of disease Y? What patient data are available to evaluate a molecularlyderived
clinical hypothesis?
Challenges and Our Approaches: DeepLink will close the interoperability gap that currently
prohibits molecular discoveries from leading to clinical innovations. DeepLink will be
technologically driven, addressing the challenges associated with large, heterogeneous,
semantically ambiguous, continuously changing, partially overlapping, and contextually
dependent data by using (1) scalable, distributed, and versioned graph stores; (2) semantic
technologies such as ontologies and Linked Data; (3) network analysis quality control methods;
(4) machine-learning focused data fusion methods; (5) context-aware text mining, entity
recognition and relation extraction; (6) multi-scale knowledge discovery using patient and
molecular data; and (7) presentation of actionable knowledge to clinicians and basic scientists
via user-friendly interfaces.",702655

biological (Haendel, Hoatlin, Doheny), and computational (Mungall, Su, Liu, McWeeney, Overby),
with expertise in a wide variety of data sources, types, and models as well as data integration
strategies, standards, and algorithms. We are invested in open science, reproducibility, and
lead efforts in developing open software, data standards, and crowdsourcing curation platforms.
Our vision is to demonstrate connectivity between rare disease and common diseases via
genes, pathways, and pathophysiology. We will include disease-phenotype associations,
enriched with temporal information and decomposed into biological units. Innovative integration
of mechanism and function will allow creation of candidate mechanistic graphs for each rare
disease. We will use graph matching and probabilistic techniques to support basic research
hypothesis testing as well as clinical inquiry (diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment selection).
Finally, our team is deeply committed to enabling the collective use of all public biomedical data
by making it interoperable and openly accessible for all users, in all contexts.
Semantics matter to integration. The figure highlights the landscape of existing data resources,
each contain a portion of data with specific, relevant meaning (A). Aggregation alone
often results in loss of meaning (B). Semantic and probabilistic integration approaches provision
for more advanced query answering capabilities (C). We have first hand experience overcoming
challenges found within large-scale integration projects in general, but more important, we are
very familiar with data sources and types this proposal aims to integrate. For example, knockdown
of TP53 in zebrafish is used to reduce apoptosis; naive use of the data might attribute
phenotypic effects to targeted genes. Other issues are in knowing when and how to integrate
data where the associations between entities are not equivalent, such as when one source annotates
a disease to a gene and another to a variant.
Our existing infrastructure has successfully integrated and leveraged multimodal data for
rare disease diagnosis. Here we extend these systems with new data types and new methodologies
that generalize across diseases and contexts. The TransMed Knowledge Graph will have
an intelligent, adaptive scaffolding for managing and linking the phenomenological worldview of
clinical elements with the mechanistic emphases of basic science. Connections between biological
entities and events will be represented either directly, or through chaining, enabling the use
of powerful algorithms for query and inference. Elements in the graph will be stratified by either
classical, rigid taxonomies (disease nosologies, tissue and cell type) or through dynamic groups
based on shared mechanisms of molecular pathophysiology. External data can be compared
using different criteria. For instance, two patients (one rare disease, one common disease) may
be distant in classical nosology, but neighbors in pathway space - suggesting a treatment. The
graph will be seeded from open data sources containing diverse data types, supplemented by
knowledge from the literature and clinical data. TransMed will also be readily connected to other
data stores using a quality identifier strategy, methods that predict probability of equivalency
from associated metadata, and algorithms that match graphs based on similar members.
Summary. Familiarity with the data, combined with our technical experience, and connection to
real-world use cases positions us well to be both relevant and successful in our vision.",1562568

However,
heterogeneity, dimensionality and multi-scale nature of such data (genomes, transcriptomes,
clinical variables, etc.) pose a new challenge: How can one query such dense data clouds of
mixed data as an integrated set (as opposed to variable by variable) against multiple knowledge
bases, and translate the joint molecular information into the clinical realm? Current lexical mapping
and brute-force data mining seek to make heterogeneous data interoperable and accessible
but their output is fragmented and requires expertise to assemble into coherent actionable
information. We propose DeepTranslate, an innovative approach that incorporates the known
actual physical organization of biological entities that are the substrate of pathogenesis into (i)
networks (data graphs) and (ii) hierarchies of concepts that span the multiscale space from
molecule to clinic. Organizing data sources along such natural structures will allow translation of
burgeoning high-dimensional data sets into concepts familiar to clinicians, while capturing
mechanistic relationships. DeepTranslate will take a hybrid approach to learn and organize its
content from both (i) existing generic comprehensive knowledge sources (GO, KEGG, IDC, etc.)
and (ii) newly measured instances of individual data clouds from two demonstration projects: (1)
ISB’s Pioneer 100 and (2) St. Jude Lifetime cancer survivors. We will focus on diabetes as
test case. These two studies cover a deep biological scale-space and thus can test the full extent
of the multiscale capacity of DeepTranslate in a focused application.
1. TYPES OF RESEARCH QUESTION ENABLED. How can a clinician find out that the dozens
of “out of range” variables observed in a patient’s data cloud, form a connected set with respect
to pathophysiology pathways, from gene to clinical variable? How can the high-dimensional
data of studies that measure for each individual 100+ data points of various types
(“personal data clouds”) be analyzed as one set in an integrated fashion (as opposed to variable
by variable) against existing knowledge bases and also be used to improve the databases?
DeepTranslate addresses these two types of questions and thereby will accelerate translation of
future personal data clouds into (A) care decisions and (B) hypotheses on new disease mechanisms
/ treatments, thereby benefiting providers as well as researchers.
2. USE OF EXPERTISE AND RESOURCES. • ISB: pioneer in personalized, big-data driven
medicine (Demo Project 1); biomedical content expertise; multiscale omics and molecular pathogenesis,
big data analysis, housing of databases for public access; query engine designs, GUI.
• UCSD: leader in biomedical data integration; automated assembly of molecular and clinical
data into hierarchical structures; translation between data types • U Montreal: biomedical database
curation from literature and construction of gene/protein/drug interaction networks; machine
learning, open resource database • St Jude CRH: Cancer monitoring Demo Project 2,
cancer patient data analytics.
3. POTENTIAL DATA AND INFRASTRUCTURE CHALLENGES. (a) Existing comprehensive
clinical data sources are not uniform and not explicitly based on biological networks; cross-mapping
is being performed at NLM based on lexical relationships: HPO (phenotypes) vs.
SNOMED CT (for EMR) vs. IDC or Merck Manual (for diseases). Careful selection of these
sources in close collaboration with NLM is needed. (b) Existing molecular pathway databases
are static, based on averages of heterogeneous non-stratified populations, while the newly
measured high-dimensional data clouds are varied due to intra-individual temporal fluctuation
and inter-individual variation. How this will affect building of ontotypes in our hybrid approach,
and how large cohorts of data clouds must be to offer statistical power is yet to be determined.
Our two Demonstration Projects with their uniquely deep (high-dimensional and multiscale) data
in cohorts of limited but growing size are thus crucial first steps in a long journey of collective
learning in the TRANSLATOR community.",855741

database may not contain a specific drug; binding strengths vary for specific drug–target pairs).
Consistent with the “identify-query-analyze” framework of the Translator, the agent breaks the
task of answering a given user query into four steps: (1) parsing the query into a standardized
format for internal representation, (2) high-level planning to identify relevant KSs and develop a
query strategy, (3) knowledge retrieval by executing the query, and (4) analysis and inference
on the obtained knowledge to produce an answer to the query (Figure 1). We implemented the
planning module (2) as a Markov decision process (MDP). Analysis and inference (4) is
performed using a combination of probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) and conventional
graph algorithms. To allow replanning, the agent can iterate over steps (2) – (4) to respond to
failed actions or improve on a preliminary answer.",422447

heterogeneous, and multi-source biomedical and clinical data. The primary goal of DeepLink is
to enable meaningful bidirectional translation between clinical and molecular science by closing
the interoperability gap between models and knowledge at different scales. The translator will
enhance clinical science with molecular insights from basic and translational research (e.g.
genetic variants, protein interactions, pathway functions, and cellular organization), and enable
the molecular sciences by connecting biological discoveries with their pathophysiological
consequences (e.g. diseases, signs and symptoms, pharmacological effects, physiological
systems). Fundamental differences in the language and semantics used to describe the models
and knowledge between the clinical and molecular domains results in an interoperability gap.
DeepLink will systematically and comprehensively close this gap. We will begin with the latest
technology in semantic knowledge graphs to support an extensible architecture for dynamic
data federation and knowledge harmonization. We will design a system for multi-scale model
integration that is ontology-based and will combine model execution with prior, curated
biomedical knowledge. Our design strategy will be iterative and participatory and anchored by
10 major milestones. In a series of demonstrations of DeepLink’s functions, we will address one
of the major challenges facing translational science: reproducibility of biomedical research
findings that are based on evolving molecular datasets. Reproducibility of analyses and
replication of results are central to scientific advancement. Many landmark studies have used
data that are constantly being updated, curated, and pared down over time. Our series of
demonstrations projects are designed to prototype the technology required for a scalable and
robust translator as well as the techniques we will use to close the interoperability gap for a
specific use case. The demonstration project will, itself, will be a significant and novel
contribution to science.
DeepLink will be able to answer questions that are currently enigmatic. Examples include:
- From clinicians: What is the comparative effectiveness of all the treatments for disease Y
given a patient's genetic/metabolic/proteomic profile? What are the functional variants in
cell type X that are associated with differential treatment outcomes? What metabolite
perturbations in cell type Y are associated with different subtypes of disease X?
- From basic science researchers: What is known about disease Y across all model
organisms (even those not designed to model Y)? What are all the clinical phenotypes that
result from a change in function in protein X? Which biological pathways are affected by a
pathogenic variant of disease Y? What patient data are available to evaluate a molecularlyderived
clinical hypothesis?
Challenges and Our Approaches: DeepLink will close the interoperability gap that currently
prohibits molecular discoveries from leading to clinical innovations. DeepLink will be
technologically driven, addressing the challenges associated with large, heterogeneous,
semantically ambiguous, continuously changing, partially overlapping, and contextually
dependent data by using (1) scalable, distributed, and versioned graph stores; (2) semantic
technologies such as ontologies and Linked Data; (3) network analysis quality control methods;
(4) machine-learning focused data fusion methods; (5) context-aware text mining, entity
recognition and relation extraction; (6) multi-scale knowledge discovery using patient and
molecular data; and (7) presentation of actionable knowledge to clinicians and basic scientists
via user-friendly interfaces.",854309

Reasoning Over Biomedical Objects linked in Knowledge-Oriented Pathways
(ROBOKOP)—to address, in a fully automated way, user queries that can be answered by
concurrent reasoning across Knowledge Sources (KSs) by means of a Knowledge Graph (KG).
Our proof-of-concept (POC) product, PROTOCOP, represents a generalizable solution for
reasoning across KSs to identify answers to clinical and translational research questions such as
establishing data-supported Clinical Outcomes Pathways (COPs) of drugs or pathways explaining
disease-disease interactions. PROTOCOP incorporates several KSs identified by the Translator
project (e.g., chem2bio2rdf, Biolink, Pharos), as well as additional KSs that may be of value to
the broader Translator program such as Chemotext (chemotext.mml.unc.edu), which is a publiclyavailable
webserver that mines the published literature in PubMed in the form of Medical Subject
Headings (MeSH) terms. PROTOCOP has successfully identified solutions to the initial two
translational query types: (1) genetic conditions that protect against disease; and (2) COPs for
drug-condition pairs. Over the 10-month project period, we will refine and evaluate our approach
as we move from PROTOCOP to ROBOKOP and embed it in fully operational and user-friendly
software. We will develop automated approaches to identify high-scoring connected subgraphs
that translate into well-reasoned, data-supported, biological pathways that explain drug action
and disease mechanisms and that may help elucidate new drug targets. In addition, we will
expand the set of allowable queries to include those that rely on longitudinal clinical data and
time- and geospatial-dependent socio-environmental exposures data. We expect that once
developed, ROBOKOP will enable novel, testable hypothesis generation for a number of
biomedical challenges such as drug repurposing, detection of disease comorbidities, mechanistic
interpretation of disease phenotypes in terms of underlying endotypes, and others.",1160000

We used Git for distributed source code control, distributed project management, and code deployment. We implemented a blackboard-­like software module (Orangeboard) that provides a knowledge-­graph object model (including information about source database and edge types for seven different types of relationships) and the ability to load the graph into Neo4j using a high-­performance bulk­-transfer (parameterized Cypher) and protocol (Bolt). We implemented Python classes to provide RESTful querying functionality for 14 different knowledge sources (Monarch/BioLink, DisGeNET, Disease Ontology, GeneProf, miRBase, miRGate, MyGene.info, OMIM, Pathway Commons 2, Pharos, human phenotype ontology, Reactome, Monarch/SciGraph, and UniProt). We implemented client­-side HTTP request/response caching as well as non-­persistent method-­level caching in Python, to accelerate knowledge graph expansion. We implemented a BioNetExpander class that can iteratively expand a knowledge graph (in Orangeboard) from one or more seed nodes. This approach is flexible with respect to future types of queries and can accommodate future selective rules for node extension. Using BioNetExpander we are able to expand a knowledge graph from 21 seed diseases to 20,000 nodes and 800,000 relationships, in an hour. To enable path scoring, we implemented a Python class for obtaining path topological characteristics and metadata, for a given path in the Neo4j graph. We then implemented Python-­based scripts for querying for paths between genetic conditions and the 21 diseases (Q1), and for the 1,000 drug/disease pairs (Q2) in the Neo4j knowledge graph (using Cypher). We benchmarked path-­finding performance of this system and found that a typical shortest-­paths query with two fixed endpoints takes 50 ms, and thus, this approach should have low query-­response latency. In order to leverage PubMed abstract co-­occurrence information in scoring a path in the knowledge graph, we used high­-performance software (from Dr. Liang Huang’s lab) for indexing PubMed and are in the process of obtaining Normalized Google Distance (NGD) scores for pairs of genetic conditions and diseases (for Q1) and for pairs of drugs and diseases (for Q2). With the knowledge graph in hand, are in the process of refining our path­-scoring approaches for Q1 & Q2 in preparation for the POC demo.",788863

with expertise in a wide variety of data sources, types, and models as well as data integration
strategies, standards, and algorithms. We are invested in open science, reproducibility, and
lead efforts in developing open software, data standards, and crowdsourcing curation platforms.
Our vision is to demonstrate connectivity between rare disease and common diseases via
genes, pathways, and pathophysiology. We will include disease-phenotype associations,
enriched with temporal information and decomposed into biological units. Innovative integration
of mechanism and function will allow creation of candidate mechanistic graphs for each rare
disease. We will use graph matching and probabilistic techniques to support basic research
hypothesis testing as well as clinical inquiry (diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment selection).
Finally, our team is deeply committed to enabling the collective use of all public biomedical data
by making it interoperable and openly accessible for all users, in all contexts.
Semantics matter to integration. The figure highlights the landscape of existing data resources,
each contain a portion of data with specific, relevant meaning (A). Aggregation alone
often results in loss of meaning (B). Semantic and probabilistic integration approaches provision
for more advanced query answering capabilities (C). We have first hand experience overcoming
challenges found within large-scale integration projects in general, but more important, we are
very familiar with data sources and types this proposal aims to integrate. For example, knockdown
of TP53 in zebrafish is used to reduce apoptosis; naive use of the data might attribute
phenotypic effects to targeted genes. Other issues are in knowing when and how to integrate
data where the associations between entities are not equivalent, such as when one source annotates
a disease to a gene and another to a variant.
Our existing infrastructure has successfully integrated and leveraged multimodal data for
rare disease diagnosis. Here we extend these systems with new data types and new methodologies
that generalize across diseases and contexts. The TransMed Knowledge Graph will have
an intelligent, adaptive scaffolding for managing and linking the phenomenological worldview of
clinical elements with the mechanistic emphases of basic science. Connections between biological
entities and events will be represented either directly, or through chaining, enabling the use
of powerful algorithms for query and inference. Elements in the graph will be stratified by either
classical, rigid taxonomies (disease nosologies, tissue and cell type) or through dynamic groups
based on shared mechanisms of molecular pathophysiology. External data can be compared
using different criteria. For instance, two patients (one rare disease, one common disease) may
be distant in classical nosology, but neighbors in pathway space - suggesting a treatment. The
graph will be seeded from open data sources containing diverse data types, supplemented by
knowledge from the literature and clinical data. TransMed will also be readily connected to other
data stores using a quality identifier strategy, methods that predict probability of equivalency
from associated metadata, and algorithms that match graphs based on similar members.
Summary. Familiarity with the data, combined with our technical experience, and connection to
real-world use cases positions us well to be both relevant and successful in our vision.",182410

be distant in classical nosology, but neighbors in pathway space - suggesting a treatment. The

biological mechanisms, and clinicians, who diagnose patient symptoms, is that many links
between biological processes and disease pathophysiology are poorly understood. A
comprehensive Biomedical Translator must enable chains of inference across objects as
diverse as genetic mutations, molecular effects, tissue-specific expression patterns,
cellular processes, organ phenotypes, disease states, patient symptoms, and drug
responses, a challenge beyond the scope of any one organization.
Fortunately, many individual links in this chain have been made by experiments yielding
statistical connections between individual data types. High-throughput perturbation screens
link chemical and genetic perturbations to cellular phenotypes such as gene-expression
patterns, cell survival, or changes in phosphorylation. Genetic association studies link
mutations to human disease or intermediate phenotypes and biomarkers. Electronic medical
records (EMR) link diseases or human phenotypes to diagnostic or current procedural
terminology (CPT) codes, and clinical trials link the impact of drugs and drug candidates on
disease states.
In principle, incorporating these links into chains of inference could translate results between
the full set of data types within them. In practice, each link is maintained by experts with
domain-specific experiments, semantic terminology, and methodological standards. While a key
challenge faced by a global Biomedical Translator is to establish consistent standards across
these existing data types, a more important goal is to develop a principled and robust
framework to (a) model biological systems and experimental approaches to investigate them;
(b) organize knowledge about biological mechanism and disease; and (c) incorporate
diverse datasets that serve as windows into the underlying and unknown state of nature.
We propose to implement a Biomedical Translator as a probabilistic graphical model, a
paradigm from artificial intelligence (AI) research. Just as separate research communities form
weakly coupled parts of the translation process, graphical models allow global inferences from
weakly coupled “nodes”. These inferences require each node to publish only probability
distributions, enabling interoperability without necessarily having global entity-resolution
standards, and benefit from paradigms for quality control, fault tolerance, and relevance
assessment common in AI research. We hypothesize that a limited number of APIs,
implemented as probability computations by communities around the world, would yield a
Biomedical Translator as an emergent property of weakly coupled knowledge sources.
From basic properties of graphical models, such a Translator could probabilistically translate
among any data types connected within it, allowing for relatively complex query concepts. For
example: What cellular processes in which tissues are impacted in a patient-based EMR? What
genetic mutations sensitize cells to small-molecule treatment effects? Which small molecules
mimic genetic “experiments of nature” that protect against disease?
To illustrate the value of these resources and our architectural paradigm, we propose a
demonstration project to implement a Biomedical Translator supporting queries between
small molecules, biological processes, genes, and disease. The demonstration project will
provide a valuable first step to confront key data-integration and organizational challenges and
will enable previously impossible queries, such as identifying small molecules that perturb the
same biological processes implicated by human genetics in a disease context. In this capacity,
such Translator could realistically identify existing drugs for known symptoms (i.e., repurposing),
but could more broadly serve as an engine for hypothesis generation and
biological discovery, suggesting pre-clinical small molecules to develop based on their
observed biological activity, or providing heretofore novel links between cellular protein function
and disease pathophysiology.",651119

However,
heterogeneity, dimensionality and multi-scale nature of such data (genomes, transcriptomes,
clinical variables, etc.) pose a new challenge: How can one query such dense data clouds of
mixed data as an integrated set (as opposed to variable by variable) against multiple knowledge
bases, and translate the joint molecular information into the clinical realm? Current lexical mapping
and brute-force data mining seek to make heterogeneous data interoperable and accessible
but their output is fragmented and requires expertise to assemble into coherent actionable
information. We propose DeepTranslate, an innovative approach that incorporates the known
actual physical organization of biological entities that are the substrate of pathogenesis into (i)
networks (data graphs) and (ii) hierarchies of concepts that span the multiscale space from
molecule to clinic. Organizing data sources along such natural structures will allow translation of
burgeoning high-dimensional data sets into concepts familiar to clinicians, while capturing
mechanistic relationships. DeepTranslate will take a hybrid approach to learn and organize its
content from both (i) existing generic comprehensive knowledge sources (GO, KEGG, IDC, etc.)
and (ii) newly measured instances of individual data clouds from two demonstration projects: (1)
ISB’s Pioneer 100 and (2) St. Jude Lifetime cancer survivors. We will focus on diabetes as
test case. These two studies cover a deep biological scale-space and thus can test the full extent
of the multiscale capacity of DeepTranslate in a focused application.
1. TYPES OF RESEARCH QUESTION ENABLED. How can a clinician find out that the dozens
of “out of range” variables observed in a patient’s data cloud, form a connected set with respect
to pathophysiology pathways, from gene to clinical variable? How can the high-dimensional
data of studies that measure for each individual 100+ data points of various types
(“personal data clouds”) be analyzed as one set in an integrated fashion (as opposed to variable
by variable) against existing knowledge bases and also be used to improve the databases?
DeepTranslate addresses these two types of questions and thereby will accelerate translation of
future personal data clouds into (A) care decisions and (B) hypotheses on new disease mechanisms
/ treatments, thereby benefiting providers as well as researchers.
2. USE OF EXPERTISE AND RESOURCES. ■ ISB: pioneer in personalized, big-data driven
medicine (Demo Project 1); biomedical content expertise; multiscale omics and molecular pathogenesis,
big data analysis, housing of databases for public access; query engine designs, GUI.
■ UCSD: leader in biomedical data integration; automated assembly of molecular and clinical
data into hierarchical structures; translation between data types ■ U Montreal: biomedical database
curation from literature and construction of gene/protein/drug interaction networks; machine
learning, open resource database ■ St Jude CRH: Cancer monitoring Demo Project 2,
cancer patient data analytics.
3. POTENTIAL DATA AND INFRASTRUCTURE CHALLENGES. (a) Existing comprehensive
clinical data sources are not uniform and not explicitly based on biological networks; cross-mapping
is being performed at NLM based on lexical relationships: HPO (phenotypes) vs.
SNOMED CT (for EMR) vs. IDC or Merck Manual (for diseases). Careful selection of these
sources in close collaboration with NLM is needed. (b) Existing molecular pathway databases
are static, based on averages of heterogeneous non-stratified populations, while the newly
measured high-dimensional data clouds are varied due to intra-individual temporal fluctuation
and inter-individual variation. How this will affect building of ontotypes in our hybrid approach,
and how large cohorts of data clouds must be to offer statistical power is yet to be determined.
Our two Demonstration Projects with their uniquely deep (high-dimensional and multiscale) data
in cohorts of limited but growing size are thus crucial first steps in a long journey of collective
learning in the TRANSLATOR community.",1408263

clinical and translational research by permitting clinicians, nurses, biomedical researchers, and
clinical scientists to query, exploit, and contribute to a federated collection of complex and highly
disparate data with medical importance. This data federation—a “quasi-comprehensive” medical
federation—will enable interrogators to pose questions about human health and disease that
could not heretofore have been imagined. We anticipate that these analyses will increase, in
ways that are paradigm shifting, our understanding of new treatments and treatment targets,
mechanisms of disease and disease transmission, environmental triggers, opportunities for drug
repurposing, molecular candidates, and systems biology pathways.
To realize this vision, we propose a trajectory that permits the realization of such a
federation. We intend to start modestly and prototype the CBDT using the unique tools we have
been building for other informatics projects, and then iteratively improve the CBDT in
collaboration with NCATS. Ultimately, the CBDT federation will need to be socialized,
permitted, and nurtured in order to realize its full potential. Indeed, we believe that the biggest
single challenge will be establishing a governance model that permits the assembly of
information pulled from across institutions and organizations. We discuss this issue in Section
2.2.1.
The CBDT must be:
• Dynamic: regularly updated to accommodate the addition of new data and data sources;
• Agile: modifiable for uses beyond the original design and adaptable for other data analysis;
• Usable: permitting differential access and levels of access (view, edit, etc.) to the data, and
permitting use by both experts and new users with modest training;
• Rational: the data will be clinically and scientifically relevant, as well as informed by policy
and protocols, and the system will provide answers with contextual meta-data; and
• Curated: the data will have associated provenance and quality measures, including
statistical relevance where appropriate.
We envision a dynamic system that supports data ingestion and subsequent
curation, federation, and exploitation (see figure). We have assembled a
team that has a track record of interdisciplinary collaboration and development of open
source tools. We propose a demonstration project that is feasible in the 2-year
time frame, but demonstrates all of the key functionality that the final
system must possess.",454336

heterogeneous, and multi-source biomedical and clinical data. The primary goal of DeepLink is
to enable meaningful bidirectional translation between clinical and molecular science by closing
the interoperability gap between models and knowledge at different scales. The translator will
enhance clinical science with molecular insights from basic and translational research (e.g.
genetic variants, protein interactions, pathway functions, and cellular organization), and enable
the molecular sciences by connecting biological discoveries with their pathophysiological
consequences (e.g. diseases, signs and symptoms, pharmacological effects, physiological
systems). Fundamental differences in the language and semantics used to describe the models
and knowledge between the clinical and molecular domains results in an interoperability gap.
DeepLink will systematically and comprehensively close this gap. We will begin with the latest
technology in semantic knowledge graphs to support an extensible architecture for dynamic
data federation and knowledge harmonization. We will design a system for multi-scale model
integration that is ontology-based and will combine model execution with prior, curated
biomedical knowledge. Our design strategy will be iterative and participatory and anchored by
10 major milestones. In a series of demonstrations of DeepLink’s functions, we will address one
of the major challenges facing translational science: reproducibility of biomedical research
findings that are based on evolving molecular datasets. Reproducibility of analyses and
replication of results are central to scientific advancement. Many landmark studies have used
data that are constantly being updated, curated, and pared down over time. Our series of
demonstrations projects are designed to prototype the technology required for a scalable and
robust translator as well as the techniques we will use to close the interoperability gap for a
specific use case. The demonstration project will, itself, will be a significant and novel
contribution to science.
DeepLink will be able to answer questions that are currently enigmatic. Examples include:
- From clinicians: What is the comparative effectiveness of all the treatments for disease Y
given a patient's genetic/metabolic/proteomic profile? What are the functional variants in
cell type X that are associated with differential treatment outcomes? What metabolite
perturbations in cell type Y are associated with different subtypes of disease X?
- From basic science researchers: What is known about disease Y across all model
organisms (even those not designed to model Y)? What are all the clinical phenotypes that
result from a change in function in protein X? Which biological pathways are affected by a
pathogenic variant of disease Y? What patient data are available to evaluate a molecularlyderived
clinical hypothesis?
Challenges and Our Approaches: DeepLink will close the interoperability gap that currently
prohibits molecular discoveries from leading to clinical innovations. DeepLink will be
technologically driven, addressing the challenges associated with large, heterogeneous,
semantically ambiguous, continuously changing, partially overlapping, and contextually
dependent data by using (1) scalable, distributed, and versioned graph stores; (2) semantic
technologies such as ontologies and Linked Data; (3) network analysis quality control methods;
(4) machine-learning focused data fusion methods; (5) context-aware text mining, entity
recognition and relation extraction; (6) multi-scale knowledge discovery using patient and
molecular data; and (7) presentation of actionable knowledge to clinicians and basic scientists
via user-friendly interfaces.",1183132

biological mechanisms, and clinicians, who diagnose patient symptoms, is that many links
between biological processes and disease pathophysiology are poorly understood. A
comprehensive Biomedical Translator must enable chains of inference across objects as
diverse as genetic mutations, molecular effects, tissue-specific expression patterns,
cellular processes, organ phenotypes, disease states, patient symptoms, and drug
responses, a challenge beyond the scope of any one organization.
Fortunately, many individual links in this chain have been made by experiments yielding
statistical connections between individual data types. High-throughput perturbation screens
link chemical and genetic perturbations to cellular phenotypes such as gene-expression
patterns, cell survival, or changes in phosphorylation. Genetic association studies link
mutations to human disease or intermediate phenotypes and biomarkers. Electronic medical
records (EMR) link diseases or human phenotypes to diagnostic or current procedural
terminology (CPT) codes, and clinical trials link the impact of drugs and drug candidates on
disease states.
In principle, incorporating these links into chains of inference could translate results between
the full set of data types within them. In practice, each link is maintained by experts with
domain-specific experiments, semantic terminology, and methodological standards. While a key
challenge faced by a global Biomedical Translator is to establish consistent standards across
these existing data types, a more important goal is to develop a principled and robust
framework to (a) model biological systems and experimental approaches to investigate them;
(b) organize knowledge about biological mechanism and disease; and (c) incorporate
diverse datasets that serve as windows into the underlying and unknown state of nature.
We propose to implement a Biomedical Translator as a probabilistic graphical model, a
paradigm from artificial intelligence (AI) research. Just as separate research communities form
weakly coupled parts of the translation process, graphical models allow global inferences from
weakly coupled “nodes”. These inferences require each node to publish only probability
distributions, enabling interoperability without necessarily having global entity-resolution
standards, and benefit from paradigms for quality control, fault tolerance, and relevance
assessment common in AI research. We hypothesize that a limited number of APIs,
implemented as probability computations by communities around the world, would yield a
Biomedical Translator as an emergent property of weakly coupled knowledge sources.
From basic properties of graphical models, such a Translator could probabilistically translate
among any data types connected within it, allowing for relatively complex query concepts. For
example: What cellular processes in which tissues are impacted in a patient-based EMR? What
genetic mutations sensitize cells to small-molecule treatment effects? Which small molecules
mimic genetic “experiments of nature” that protect against disease?
To illustrate the value of these resources and our architectural paradigm, we propose a
demonstration project to implement a Biomedical Translator supporting queries between
small molecules, biological processes, genes, and disease. The demonstration project will
provide a valuable first step to confront key data-integration and organizational challenges and
will enable previously impossible queries, such as identifying small molecules that perturb the
same biological processes implicated by human genetics in a disease context. In this capacity,
such Translator could realistically identify existing drugs for known symptoms (i.e., repurposing),
but could more broadly serve as an engine for hypothesis generation and
biological discovery, suggesting pre-clinical small molecules to develop based on their
observed biological activity, or providing heretofore novel links between cellular protein function
and disease pathophysiology.",399608

However,
heterogeneity, dimensionality and multi-scale nature of such data (genomes, transcriptomes,
clinical variables, etc.) pose a new challenge: How can one query such dense data clouds of
mixed data as an integrated set (as opposed to variable by variable) against multiple knowledge
bases, and translate the joint molecular information into the clinical realm? Current lexical mapping
and brute-force data mining seek to make heterogeneous data interoperable and accessible
but their output is fragmented and requires expertise to assemble into coherent actionable
information. We propose DeepTranslate, an innovative approach that incorporates the known
actual physical organization of biological entities that are the substrate of pathogenesis into (i)
networks (data graphs) and (ii) hierarchies of concepts that span the multiscale space from
molecule to clinic. Organizing data sources along such natural structures will allow translation of
burgeoning high-dimensional data sets into concepts familiar to clinicians, while capturing
mechanistic relationships. DeepTranslate will take a hybrid approach to learn and organize its
content from both (i) existing generic comprehensive knowledge sources (GO, KEGG, IDC, etc.)
and (ii) newly measured instances of individual data clouds from two demonstration projects: (1)
ISB’s Pioneer 100 and (2) St. Jude Lifetime cancer survivors. We will focus on diabetes as
test case. These two studies cover a deep biological scale-space and thus can test the full extent
of the multiscale capacity of DeepTranslate in a focused application.
1. TYPES OF RESEARCH QUESTION ENABLED. How can a clinician find out that the dozens
of “out of range” variables observed in a patient’s data cloud, form a connected set with respect
to pathophysiology pathways, from gene to clinical variable? How can the high-dimensional
data of studies that measure for each individual 100+ data points of various types
(“personal data clouds”) be analyzed as one set in an integrated fashion (as opposed to variable
by variable) against existing knowledge bases and also be used to improve the databases?
DeepTranslate addresses these two types of questions and thereby will accelerate translation of
future personal data clouds into (A) care decisions and (B) hypotheses on new disease mechanisms
/ treatments, thereby benefiting providers as well as researchers.

cancer patient data analytics.
3. POTENTIAL DATA AND INFRASTRUCTURE CHALLENGES. (a) Existing comprehensive
clinical data sources are not uniform and not explicitly based on biological networks; cross-mapping
is being performed at NLM based on lexical relationships: HPO (phenotypes) vs.
SNOMED CT (for EMR) vs. IDC or Merck Manual (for diseases). Careful selection of these
sources in close collaboration with NLM is needed. (b) Existing molecular pathway databases
are static, based on averages of heterogeneous non-stratified populations, while the newly
measured high-dimensional data clouds are varied due to intra-individual temporal fluctuation
and inter-individual variation. How this will affect building of ontotypes in our hybrid approach,
and how large cohorts of data clouds must be to offer statistical power is yet to be determined.
Our two Demonstration Projects with their uniquely deep (high-dimensional and multiscale) data
in cohorts of limited but growing size are thus crucial first steps in a long journey of collective
learning in the TRANSLATOR community.",1071976
