 Defined regions of the United States that have historically received lower levels of NIH funding face specific
challenges for accessing key research resources to facilitate biomedical research within the mission of the
National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS). To alleviate one such challenge in these regions, we
will provide access to a national quantitative proteomics resource through the IDeA National Resource for
Quantitative Proteomics. We will provide investigators in these regions of the United States access to user-
friendly services for state-of-the-art, quantitative proteomics that will guide the user from service request to
sample analysis to delivery of publication ready data.","NIGMS","10409203","8/5/2021 12:00:00 AM","PA-20-272","3R24GM137786-02S1","3","R24","GM","137786","02","S","LIU, CHRISTINA","8/20/2020 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2025 12:00:00 AM"," "," ","8542361","TACKETT, ALAN ","KINTER, MICHAEL T","02","BIOCHEMISTRY","122452563","US","34.751472","-92.320637","1471106","UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS","LITTLE ROCK","AR","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","722057101","UNITED STATES","N","6/1/2021 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2022 12:00:00 AM","859","Other Research-Related","2021","138320"," ","NIGMS","91000","47320"," ","138320",

The proposed research is relevant to public health because it seeks to address a significant barrier to HIV
services for a key population and in the region most affected by HIV in the US. The proposed research aims to
use mixed methods to elucidate how drug use stigma impacts engagement and retention in HIV services. The
findings will be used to select and adapt an evidence-informed HIV stigma-reduction intervention to address
drug use stigma.","NIDA","10233273","4/16/2021 12:00:00 AM","RFA-DA-21-002","1R21DA053694-01","1","R21","DA","053694","01"," ","HARTSOCK, PETER","5/1/2021 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2023 12:00:00 AM","ZDA1-PXN-F(21)R"," ","11207604","BROWNE, FELICIA AMIRA","Not Applicable","04","Unavailable","004868105","US","35.366248","-79.429394","6939101","RESEARCH TRIANGLE INSTITUTE","RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK","NC","Research Institutes","277092194","UNITED STATES","N","5/1/2021 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2022 12:00:00 AM","279","Non-SBIR/STTR","2021","245940"," ","NIDA","150000","95940"," ","245940",
