When I interviewed in 2009, I had to find my way onto an obscure IRC server, wait in a lobby all day until a volunteer moderator could get to me, and was then grilled on the arcana of digital music formats, spectral analysis[^spectral], the ethics of piracy, and so on for half an hour. Getting a question wrong was an instant failure and you were banned from the server for 48 hours. A single user was only allowed one account per lifetime, so between that policy and the extremely high barriers to entries, even anonymous users were strongly incentivized to follow [the sophisticated, exacting rules for contributing](https://opentrackers.org/whatinterviewprep.com/prepare-for-the-interview/what-cd-rules/index.html). While we certainly don't want such a grueling barrier to entry for scientific data infrastructure, the problem is different and arguably simpler when the system can exist in the open. For example public reputation loss can be a reasonably strong incentive to play by the rules that may trade off with the threat of banning.

[^spectral]: The average what.cd user was, as a result, on par with many of the auditory neuroscientists I know in their ability to read a spectrogram.

Depending on the age of your account and the amount you had contributed, what.cd users also were given *user classes* that conferred differing degrees of prestige and abilities. This is a common tactic for publicly moderates sites like [StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com) or [Genius](https://genius.com), where users need to demonstrate a certain degree of competency and good faith before they are given the keys to the castle. User classes are both *aspirational* and incentivize additional work on the site, as well as *reputational* where a user class meant you have paid your dues and were a senior contributor.

If the moderation team affirmed your report, they would usually kick back a few gigabytes of upload credit depending on the severity. Unless the problem was a repeat and malicious one, the "offender" was alerted to it, warned, and told what to do instead next time -- though,

Independent musicians released albums in the supportive[^mostly] Vanity House section, and people from around the world came to hold the one true album that only they knew about high aloft like a divine tablet.

[^mostly]: Mostly. You know how the internet goes...


They continue to ideas like greater reward for data citations (which we will return to in [credit assignment](#credit-assignment)), as well as awards for good datasets. Community awards are also longstanding parts of many digital communities, like What.cd's Album of the Week, which rewarded someone who has done good work by letting them choose an album that would be freely downloadable, or Wikipedia's [Barnstars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Barnstars).

A better system for science might be closer to [ratioless trackers](https://wiki.installgentoo.com/wiki/Private_trackers#No_economy) that allow infinite downloads as long as they remain seeded for a certain amount of time afterwards, given whatever permissions have been set on the data.


These are all solvable problems, and can be worked on iteratively. They hint at a communication medium where we can discuss our experiments in the same place that they live; linking, embedding, comparing data and techniques to have the kind of longform, cumulative scientific discourse that is for now still relegated to being a fever dream. Rather than being prescriptive about one community structure, what allowed private bittorent trackers to develop and experiment with many different types of systems is the separation from the underlying data from the community overlay.
